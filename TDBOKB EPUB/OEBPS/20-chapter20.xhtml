  <p>
  	Theo
  opened his eyes to find himself lying on his back on a broad, warm
  rock in the sun. His clothes were caked with mud. He put his hands to
  his face to find that his face had been wiped clean.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Buford sat on his chest.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo set Buford aside and sat
  up. He patted himself all over to check for injuries. Aside from some
  bruises he seemed to be in one piece. Beside the rock, the wide river
  of mud raged. At the far side of the river the black, craggy ridge
  rose abruptly.
  </p>
  <p>
  	As the far end of the rocks,
  about a ten yards away from where Theo sat, stood a rudimentary
  teepee made of three large, leafy tree branches. Theo stood and
  walked toward the teepee.
  </p>
  <p>
  	From the far side of the
  teepee Theo heard a munching sound. He peeked cautiously around the
  teepee.</p>
  <p>
  	The hermit sat cross-legged on
  the rock, naked except for a dingy old pair of plaid shorts. His body
  was just leathery skin and bones and his eyes were sunken. His white
  hair stuck out straight from his head in clumps several feet long and
  his beard extended to his belly.  He chewed on something crunchy. In
  front of him was a large pile of dead cicadas.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo approached the hermit.</p>
  <p>
  	“Thanks,” said Theo.</p>
  <p>
  	The hermit didn't look up.
  “For what?”</p>
  <p>
  	“For pulling me out,” said
  Theo.	</p>
  <p>
  	The hermit shrugged.</p>
  <p>
  	“Wasn't me,” he said.</p>
  <p>
  	Theo looked around. There was
  no trace of anyone else.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Well, who was it then?”
  said Theo.</p>
  <p>
  	“I dunno,” said the
  hermit. “A bird maybe. Maybe a chipmunk. You don't look like you
  weigh much.”</p>
  <p>
  	Theo wasn't sure if the hermit
  was making a joke, but he didn't find it very funny.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I need to get out of Kook
  Bog,” he said.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The hermit munched silently
  for a while without responding. At length, he picked up a cicada from
  his pile and extended his hand to Theo.</p>
  <p>
  	“Cicada?” he said.</p>
  <p>
  	Theo crinkled his nose.</p>
  <p>
  	“Did you hear me?” he
  said. “I want you to tell me how to get out of here.”</p>
  <p>
  	The hermit looked at Buford,
  who sat a few feet away.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I bet you want one,” said
  the hermit. He flicked the cicada at Buford. Buford's tongue shot out
  snapped up the insect.</p>
  <p>
  	The hermit turned back to
  Theo. He gestured at the looming, precipitous ridge across the wide,
  wild river of mud.</p>
  <p>
  	“Thataway,” he said.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I can't get across that,”
  said Theo. “I need to know another way.”</p>
  <p>
  	The hermit scoffed and took a
  bite of a cicada.</p>
  <p>
  	“You ought to try one,” he
  said. “They're tastier than they look. You won't appreciate the
  subtleties, of course, but you don't need to be a connoisseur to
  enjoy 'em.”</p>
  <p>
  	“I don't want to eat your
  stupid bugs,” said Theo. “I want to get out of here.”</p>
  <p>
  	The hermit shot Theo an
  irritated look.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“All right then,” he said.
  “Get out of here. Let me eat my lunch in peace.”</p>
  <p>
  	“They say you know how to
  get out of Kook Bog,” said Theo. “The real way.”
  </p>
  <p>
  	The hermit scrunched up his
  face.</p>
  <p>
  	“Maybe I do. But I'd be
  wasting my breath telling you,” said the hermit.</p>
  <p>
  	Theo fumed.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Those kooks were right
  about you,” he said. “You're no help to anybody.”</p>
  <p>
  	For a second, a hurt look
  flashed across the hermit's eyes. But a moment later it was gone.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Me and the world are
  even-Steven, boy,” the hermit.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The hermit flicked a cicada
  straight at Theo's face.</p>
  <p>
  	“One for the road,” said
  the hermit.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo flinched. Buford's tongue
  flashed and the cicada vanished. Buford croaked contentedly. 	</p>
  <p>
  	Theo stood for a moment on the
  verge of tears. There was nothing more he could say. The old man at
  the inn had been right. The hermit was no use to anyone. Theo walked
  back to the far edge of the rock. Far in the distance, he could see
  the curling smoke from the village chimneys. He turned back to look
  once more at the hermit's teepee. He could hear the hermit still
  munching away.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo gulped down his
  disappointment and stepped into the mud.

  </p>

</p>
  <p >
  	Berke sat on his stool on the
  dock at the gondola terminus. His 15-foot-range Remote Person
  Extractor leaned against his shoulder, looking suspiciously like an
  ordinary stick.
  </p>
  <p >
  	The gondola clanked and Berke
  jolted awake, but there was no splash. Nobody was aboard the gondola.

  </p>
  <p >
  	Berke squinted at the gondola,
  puzzled. There was something else there. A length of heavy rope hung
  from the bar of the gondola. At the end of the rope, about an foot
  short of the mud, dangled a loop in the shape of a hangman's noose.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Berke reached out with the
  Remote Person Extractor (which really was an incredibly useful and
  multi-purpose device) and fished the loop over to the dock.
  </p>
  <p>
  	A
  small white envelope was affixed with cellophane tape to the end of
  the loop. Across the front of the envelope, in tidy handwritten
  script, were the words <em>To
  Whom It May Concern</em>.

  </p>

  </div>
</p>
  <p>
  	Theo
  trudged through the mud towards the village, swatting at the bugs
  that still clustered around his arm. His stomach rumbled. He wasn't
  hungry enough to start eating cicadas, but he was getting close. He
  thought about Dorothy's sausages and a wave of guilt came over him.
  </p>
  <p>
  	He'd lost the wager. The old
  man was going to  demand his payment. And what would Theo do then? He
  tried to think of a plan. He could refuse to turn Buford over to the
  old man. But Dorothy had been a witness to his promise. Everyone in
  Kook Bog would know he was not to be trusted. If he was going to be
  stuck here that didn't seem like a good way to begin. Besides, it
  wouldn't take many of them ganging up on him to take Buford by force,
  and then he wouldn't even have his toad for a friend.</p>
  <p>
  	He could let Buford go and
  tell the old man that Buford escaped. Who knew what the old man would
  demand as a substitute payment, but surely it would be better than
  betraying Buford. Of course that assumed  Buford would go if Theo let
  him. Thus far, Buford had proved to be a stubbornly loyal companion.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo's stomach knotted up. He
  couldn't simply turn Buford over to be filleted. He was far too
  hungry himself to consider making a dash into the wilderness. But if
  he put up a fight it was doubtful Dorothy would extend her
  hospitality to him any further.
  </p>
  <p>
  	He felt Buford squirm in his
  pocket.</p>
  <p>
  	“I'll think of something,”
  he said.
  </p>
  <p>
  	He'd have to buy some time
  until he got something to eat. He would sneak to the inn and ask
  Dorothy for a meal first. If he was lucky, maybe the old man wouldn't
  be there. After that, who knew. Maybe he'd fight. Maybe he'd run off
  into the bog again and never come back. If he could only get some
  food in his belly maybe it would be easier to come up with a plan.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The sun was setting as the
  edge of the village came into view. He could see the lights through
  the trees. There were the broken railings and the crumbling walkways
  of the neglected edge of the village he had departed from the day
  before.</p>
  <p>
  	But it wasn't neglected now.</p>
  <p>
  	On the contrary, there were
  people, <em>many</em>
  people, congregated on the deck. And not just one deck, either. More
  people gathered even as he approached. The entire edge of the
  village, the decks, the boardwalks and the broken, disused
  communication gazebo were all filling with people. The whole of Kook
  Bog seemed to be gathering here at the village edge. And as Theo
  waded closer, he became uncomfortably aware that they were all
  looking at him.
  </p>
  <p>
  	So much for sneaking in for
  some grub.
  </p>
  <p>
  	It was much worse than he had
  imagined. He would never have thought the old man would go to such
  lengths for a toad. And he certainly never would have dreamed the
  entire village of Kook Bog would have acted in such solidarity to
  enforce the deal.
  </p>
  <p>
  	His heart sank. He couldn't
  possibly fight the whole village. They'd tear him limb from limb.</p>
  <p>
  	Theo stopped about a hundred
  yards from the deck. He looked around for alternatives. There was
  nowhere else to go, only trees and mud in every direction. Hunger
  gnawed at his belly.</p>
  <p>
  	A stout tree stood ahead of
  him just to the left. He veered slightly in that direction so that
  his body was partially concealed from the view of the villagers. As
  quickly as he could, he pulled Buford out of his pocket with his
  hidden hand and tossed the toad away.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Go!” he whispered out of
  the corner of his mouth without a sidelong glance.  He waded straight
  towards the village.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The decks groaned under the
  weight of the villagers who had gathered to watch Theo as he
  returned. He pushed his way through the last of the mud and stood at
  the edge of the crumbling deck. The crowd of villagers backed away
  from the edge, giving him space to climb onto the deck.
  </p>
  <p>
  	He stood up and looked around.
  All eyes were on him. The expressions on people's faces were
  unreadable. The old man was there too, staring at Theo just like
  everyone else.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo started to explain that
  Buford had escaped, but no sooner had he opened his mouth than he
  heard a thump on the deck beside his feet. He looked down to see
  Buford, sitting attentively at his side. With a start, he reached
  down and picked the toad up. He held Buford defensively in both hands
  against his chest. His heart pounded.
  </p>
  <p>
  	From the midst of the crowd,
  Berke lumbered forward. He stood in front of Theo with a look of
  stunned disbelief.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I'm not quite sure how to
  explain this,” he said. “I think I'd better just show you.”</p>
  <p>
  	He unfolded a piece of paper
  and held it out for Theo to read. The message was handwritten in
  neat, precise letters. It read:</p>
  <p>
  	<em>Send
  the boy back up.</em></p>
  <p>
  	<em>Regards,
  Cess</em></p>
