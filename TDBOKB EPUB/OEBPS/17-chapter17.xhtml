  <p>
  	The sun rose over the bug
  fields of Kook Bog. The trees were sparser here than in the village
  and it was  much brighter.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The bug fields were not really
  fields at all.   Rather, they were expanses of deep, mossy mud and
  lush, low flora. The grass was so thick in some places it looked as
  though a rabbit could run across it, but the ground beneath was
  liquid; any rabbit that tried would sink like a stone. A green mist
  of aphids hung in the air like a flimsy silk scarf, and various
  insects fluttered and swarmed in clumps and clouds throughout the
  fields.
  </p>
  <p>
  	A makeshift lean-to of leaves
  and branches sat atop a large knot at the base of an enormous tree in
  the midst of the bug fields. The leaves shuddered and parted and Rudy
  Promovendis emerged.
  </p>
  <p>
  	It was clear that he had been
  roughing it. His hair, always disheveled, was now such a tangled,
  matted mess that it was impossible to tell where his own hair ended
  and the twigs and leaves began. His clothes, face, and hands were
  stained and caked with mud. Nevertheless, his movements were
  energetic and alert. A pair of primitive snowshoe-like platforms made
  of leaves and branches were tied to his feet. He stepped lightly off
  the tree and onto the mud.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Rudy tramped across the bug
  fields slowly but steadily in his crude mud-shoes. He carried a
  palette made from a chunk of tree bark.
  </p>
  <p>
  	He approached a low, thick
  plant with large, succulent leaves. He stripped off a piece of one
  leaf and squeezed it over a corner of the palette. A cloudy, greenish
  fluid oozed out. He touched the fluid with his pinky and tasted it.
  He nodded approvingly to himself.
  </p>
  <p>
  	He approached a different
  plant. This one had huge white and orange flowers that grew in
  clusters at the end of long, rough stalks. He reached into one of the
  flowers and plucked its pistil. The tip of the pistil was covered
  with fine yellow powder. He dipped it into the greenish fluid on his
  palette and mixed it around. The powder swirled into the fluid.</p>
  <p>
  	A multifarious cloud of
  insects began to form around Rudy. They swirled gently around the
  palette.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Rudy peeled a large, white
  petal from the flower of still another plant. He sniffed it. He
  dipped a sharpened twig into the yellow-green fluid on the palette.
  With the twig, he drew a line on the surface of the white petal.
  </p>
  <p>
  	From the swirling cloud of
  bugs a column shot up in a straight trajectory at about a 45 degree
  angle to the ground. Rudy drew another line at a right angle to the
  first line. The stream of bugs turned abruptly in the air. Rudy
  smiled.</p>
  <p>
  	He reached into his pouch and
  withdrew his fingertip covered with white powder. With his figner, he
  mixed the white powder into half of the fluid on the palette. He
  dipped the twig into the new mix.
  </p>
  <p>
  	He drew a series of lines
  extending from the first two lines. In the sky above, a phalanx of
  purple and gold butterflies split off from the main stream of
  insects, following the new lines.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Rudy mixed more ingredients
  and drew more lines and various insects responded in different ways.
  The lines he drew curled and looped on the broad white petal. He
  looked up and smiled.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The
  sky was covered with a brightly colored, complex lace of insects. The
  air itself seemed to shine and swirl in ornate, colorful patterns. An
  enormous, fleeting rainbow glistened off a column of bluebottles that
  extended high into the sky. Rudy scribbled some more and a red thread
  of ladybugs snaked crazily through a paisley pattern of pale blue
  moths. The sky was a bright, shifting canvas and Rudy painted his
  designs like an excited child.
