  <p>
  	Cynthia
  Digniggleby was in her bathrobe and curlers making toast when Valerie
  cleared the stairs in two strides and dashed out the front door.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Valerie?”</p>
  <p>
  	“I'll be back late!”
  called Valerie. “Don't wait up!”</p>
  <p>
  	With that, the door slammed
  and Valerie was gone.</p>
  <p>
  	Mayor Digniggleby looked up
  from his oatmeal.
  </p>
  <p>
  	When Valerie arrived at the
  shelter, Theo was ready to leave.</p>
  <p>
  	“It took you long enough,”
  said Theo.</p>
  <p>
  	“I'm here now,” said
  Valerie.</p>
  <p>
  	Theo handed her his bag and a
  small, corked bottle of deep pink leonore extract.</p>
  <p>
  	“I made a fresh batch,” he
  said. “This is very potent. Use it like I told you, but don't leave
  it exposed to the air.”</p>
  <p>
  	Valerie nodded. “Just don't
  be late. My parents will start looking for me if it gets late.”</p>
  <p>
  	“I'm not going to be late,”
  said Theo.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Valerie scrunched her nose.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“What's <em>that</em>?”
  she said, pointing at a wriggling lump in Theo's breast pocket.</p>
  <p >
  	Theo blushed.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“It's my toad,” he said
  irritably.
  </p>
  <p >
  ❉</p>
  <p>
  	Ballhatchet
  and Dooley sat side by side across the desk from Cess.	</p>
  <p>
  	“Sorry
  to disappoint you boss,” said Dooley.</p>
  <p>
  	“I'll live,” said Cess.</p>
  <p>
  	“I think we need to take
  another approach,” said Dooley.</p>
  <p>
  	“I've been thinking
  sausages,” said Ballhatchet. “Or maybe grapes. But Dooley——”</p>
  <p>
  	“Ballhatchet, shut up,”
  said Dooley.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Dooley doesn't like my
  ideas,” finished Ballhatchet.</p>
  <p>
  	Cess
  stood and walked over to the bookshelf. He took down a large jar of
  deep pink fluid. He placed it on the desk in front of Ballhatchet and
  Dooley.</p>
  <p>
  	“This will attract the
  insects,” he said. “Once you've managed that, the sack should
  suffice.”
  </p>
  <p >
  ❉</p>
  <p>
   	Theo crouched behind a shrub
  on the corner near the entrance of the patent office and watched as
  Ballhatchet and Dooley walked out the front door.</p>
  <p>
  	“For the last time, enough
  about the sausages!” said Dooley.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The two men disappeared down
  the street.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo looked around to make
  sure nobody was watching him. He jogged over to the patent office
  building.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Above him, the elevator
  rattled. It came to rest on the ground floor. The front door of the
  patent office opened again and Theo dove behind one of the scaffold
  beams that supported the building above.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Chief Patent Administrator
  Horace E. Cess emerged from the building. He wore a top hat and tails
  and carried a gold-tipped walking stick. He puffed up his chest,
  tucked the walking stick under one arm, and walked down the street
  away from the patent office.</p>
  <p>
  	As soon as Cess rounded the
  corner Theo hoisted himself onto the beam. The beam was lined with
  metal pegs all the way up, and Theo could climb it as easily as
  climbing a ladder.
  </p>
  <p>
  	It was a long way up to the
  house, but the scaffolding and elevator apparatus kept him well
  concealed. Halfway up, Theo sat down on a shaft behind a massive
  flywheel to catch his breath. He peeked out from among the girders
  and looked out over Mossville. Even from here the view was
  impressive. He saw the sea of red-tiled roofs that surrounded the
  town square and stretched up the side of the valley to the west. The
  roofs became more sparse as they rose up the slope into the woods in
  the direction of Theo's home. To the east, the buildings ended much
  more abruptly, well short of the craggy black edge of the ravine
  beyond. Overhead, the Suction-Flux Hydro-Debogilator spanned the sky
  in a soaring parabola from the town square into the mist of the
  ravine.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo continued to climb. About
  three-quarters of the way up he reached a rickety wooden stairwell
  that spiraled upward around the elevator shaft. He stepped onto the
  stairwell. He was high enough now that there was little chance anyone
  would see him from the ground.
  </p>
  <p>
  	As he climbed, he passed
  platforms and balconies that jutted from the stairwell at odd angles.
  Soon he was level with the bottom-most rooms of the house. A walkway
  ran from the stairs to the lowest floor of the house. It was scarcely
  more than the size of a broom closet and nuzzled up against the side
  of the elevator shaft. The bottom of the house was shaped something
  like a radish. The floors were wider as he went up, and more walkways
  split off from the stairs towards other doors. Ladders led to still
  other sets of stairs.</p>
  <p>
  	Theo continued upward through
  the bird's nest of walkways and balconies. He climbed past shuttered
  windows and wood-shingled gables until he reached the topmost balcony
  of the house. A chilly breeze ruffled his hair.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The platform he stood on was
  scarcely big enough for one person to stand on comfortably. At one
  corner of the balcony a steel pole rose up into the air.  At the top
  of the pole a bullwheel supported a cable that stretched off eastward
  towards another similar pole far off in the hazy distance.
  </p>
  <p>
  	A wooden sign in the shape of
  an arrow pointing east hung on the railing of the balcony. It read
  <em>KOOK BOG</em>.</p>
  <p>
  	About ten feet below him was
  another platform, from which a steel maintenance catwalk extended to
  the nearest point of the Suction-Flux Hydro-Debogilator about fifty
  yards away. The catwalk was supported by struts and cables bolted to
  the scaffolding on the near end and to the Suction-Flux
  Hydro-Debogilator itself on the far end.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The city below looked like a
  train-set town he might have built himself when he was younger. The
  tower seemed to spin slowly and Theo closed his eyes to stop the
  vertigo.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo tried the door of the
  room adjoining the balcony. It was unlocked. He went in.</p>
  <p>
  	He found himself in Mr. Cess's
  office. Theo looked at the massive wooden desk and the tall leather
  chair. The room was jammed full of shelves and file cabinets and tall
  stacks of binders, folders, and envelopes. But although it was
  chockablock to bursting with documents and containers, the details of
  the room were meticulously tidy.</p>
  <p>
  	Theo walked over to a rack of
  tightly rolled blueprints that covered the far wall. He pulled a roll
  out and stretched it out on the floor.</p>
  <p >
  ❉</p>
  <p>
  	When
  Ballhatchet and Dooley arrived at the secret shelter there was nobody
  there. Dooley held the potato sack over his shoulder and Ballhatchet
  carried the jar of leonore extract under his arm.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I guess we wait,” said
  Dooley.
  </p>
  <p>
  	They sat down on a nearby log
  where they could easily see anyone who approached. For a while
  neither of them spoke. Eventually Dooley sighed.</p>
  <p>
  	“It's stressful sometimes,”
  he said.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Mm,” said Ballhatchet.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I mean, working for Mr.
  Cess and all,” continued Dooley. “You know how demanding he is.
  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't have it any other way. He makes us
  rise to our potential. But I think maybe sometimes I take my stress
  out on you. Criticizing your ideas and all. I shouldn't do that.”</p>
  <p>
  	“Mmm,” agreed Ballhatchet.</p>
  <p>
  	A faint buzzing sound came
  through the trees.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I think it comes down to my
  own insecurity about my job performance really,” said Dooley. “I
  know I probably seem like I've always got a handle on things, but I'm
  human too. A lot of times I wonder whether I'm up to it, y'know? I
  mean, you've had my back through thick and thin, and I do appreciate
  that——”</p>
  <p>
  	Ballhatchet made a slurping
  sound.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Dooley turned to see
  Ballhatchet with his fingers in his mouth, a thick, viscous strand of
  leonore extract trailing from his mouth to the open bottle on his
  lap. Ballhatchet raised his eyebrows enthusiastically.</p>
  <p>
  	“What the heck are you
  doing?” exclaimed Dooley.</p>
  <p>
  	“I'm hungry!” said
  Ballhatchet, his lips smacking with the sticky fluid.</p>
  <p>
  	“That's for the bugs! Mr.
  Cess said to keep that shut!”</p>
  <p>
  	“It's really good!” said
  Ballhatchet. “Try some!”</p>
  <p>
  	The buzzing was loud now.
  Dooley and Ballhatchet both looked up to see a huge black swarm of
  insects about to hit.</p>
  <p>
  	“Uh-oh,” said Dooley.
  </p>
  <p >
  ❉</p>
  <p>
  	Valerie and Bea played
  together in the grass at the tip of Gurwell's field. Valerie took an
  old red ball from her purse.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“This used to be our dog,
  Finney's, but he died,” she said. “Here, catch!”</p>
  <p>
  	She tossed the ball to Bea.
  The ball struck Bea square on the chest and Bea toppled over
  backwards.</p>
  <p>
  	“Oh!” said Valerie,
  running to help Bea up. “Maybe we should start a little easier!”</p>
  <p>
  	She rolled the ball to Bea a
  few times, coaxing Bea to catch it. After five or six tries, Bea
  began to reach for the ball. Soon Bea was picking up the ball and
  rolling it back to Valerie. Before too long, they were playing catch.
  When the ball flew wide of Bea a cluster of bugs spread out from Bea
  and pulled the ball into her reach. Bea threw the ball high and
  strong to Valerie.
  </p>
  <p>
  	A buzzing sound came from
  above. Valerie looked up to see a swarm of bugs overhead flying in
  the direction of the Promovendis house. She dropped the ball.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Bea!” she cried. “Come
  here!”</p>
  <p>
  	Bea tried to run towards
  Valerie, but her bugs had already begun to go out of control.
  Clusters of bugs flew away from her to join the swarm above. A spasm
  overtook Bea and she fell to her knees.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Bea!”</p>
  <p>
  	Valerie took Theo's palette
  from her purse and struggled to remember what he had told her. Bea
  writhed and shook on the ground, her arms reaching out helplessly
  towards Valerie.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Calms her down, calms her
  down...” said Valerie to herself. She took a spoonful of yellow
  powder and tried to remember where to sprinkle it. “Easy, Bea! It's
  okay, I've got you.”</p>
  <p>
  	Valerie sprinkled the yellow
  powder on Bea's main switch panel. With a loud pop, a cloud of gnats
  burst from Bea's chest. Valerie fell backward in surprise and Bea's
  spasms became more violent than ever.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Oh!”</p>
  <p>
  	Tears filled Valerie's eyes as
  she agonized over the palette. Bea's arms and legs levitated
  sickeningly, pulled in all directions by the frenzied bugs.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Oh, I don't know!” cried
  Valerie.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Bea's foot swung around in a
  wide arc and slammed down on the palette, sending powders and liquids
  splashing. The spasms were horrific. It looked as though Bea was
  being ripped apart from within.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Valerie grabbed Bea in her
  arms and ran as fast as she could.
