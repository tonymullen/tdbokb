  <p>
  	From
  the roof of the communications gazebo, Rudy, Valerie and the rest
  watched in horror as Theo fell.	</p>
  <p>
  	“Theo!” cried Valerie.	</p>
  <p>
  	“Son!” gasped Rudy.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo's silhouette, tiny
  against the blue sky, seemed to plunge for an eternity. He turned
  slowly head over heels in the air. Seconds passed and he rushed ever
  more quickly towards the earth.</p>
  <p>
  	He disappeared beyond the
  ridge. Valerie buried her face in her hands and sobbed. Rudy gaped.
  The palette dropped from his hands and tears welled up in his eyes.

  <p>
  	The
  mud receded throughout Kook Bog. It stopped moving and the wet shine
  of its surface dulled. The air glittered with moisture.</p>
  <p>
  	Villagers and recent arrivals
  climbed from roofs and  trees. They tested the ground with their feet
  before stepping cautiously onto the soft, but firm, ground.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Beyond the edge of the
  village, the river of mud had stopped flowing. Its ripples and eddies
  looked as though they had been carved into the surface of a vast slab
  of clay.</p>
  <p>
  	The people of Kook Bog
  congregated at the banks.
  </p>
  <p>
  	A villager stepped out
  cautiously and put his foot down. The ground gave slightly but
  supported his weight. He walked out onto the river. The crowd did the
  same, tentatively in pairs and threes at first and then all together
  as a group. When they reached the other side they began to climb up
  the black rock slopes towards Mossville, finding pathways as they
  went.
  </p>
  <p>
  	In Mossville the sun shone
  brightly. The moisture in the air was dissipating but rainbows still
  hung throughout the town.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The ground was soft but firm.
  The cobblestone streets had been pulled asunder by the shifting of
  the earth beneath them. Buildings stood at surprising angles, but for
  the most part they remained intact. Cess's precariously elevated home
  and the patent office beneath it were the only structures that had
  been utterly destroyed.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The house and patent office
  lay in a gigantic, pulverized heap, deeply embedded in a wide crater
  of hardening mud. The remnants of the automatons who had worked in
  the patent office were scattered throughout the wreckage. Broken doll
  heads and skeletal metal limbs poked up through the debris. Tattered
  scraps of burlap fluttered in the wind.</p>
  <p>
  	A few yards from the rim of
  the crater, Bea lay partially submerged in mud. A light cloud of
  insects still clung to her. The cloud pulsated slowly. Then, as
  though with great effort, it began to move around her body and head.
  A few more insects from the air collected around her. Aphids split
  off from gnats and formed a wispy but coherent stream that began to
  course through Bea's circulation system. Gnats clustered around her
  joints and moths began to accumulate around her head. She began to
  stir.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Unsteadily, she raised her
  face from the mud.</p>
  <p>
  	The citizens of Mossville came
  out of their homes and hiding places to assess the scene. At first
  only a few people noticed the figures appearing over the distant
  ridge, but soon word had spread throughout Mossville. The citizens
  collected on balconies and roofs to get a better look. With
  binoculars and  telescopes, or just squinting their eyes, they
  watched as the mass of exiles approached from beyond the edge of the
  city.</p>
  <p>
  	As the growing crowd trudged
  through the still muddy fields and came into clearer view, the
  citizens began to register their recognition. Shouts went up
  throughout Mossville as fathers, mothers, aunts and uncles appeared
  over the hills. Long lost siblings shambled into view, black-sheep
  cousins and crazy godparents, caked in mud and smiling uncertainly as
  they trudged towards their homes. Another crowd gathered of citizens
  walking from the city center towards the fields to meet their
  returning loved ones.</p>
  <p>
  	Rudy, Pythagoras, Valerie, and
  the Dignigglebys moved among the returning exiles. But they were not
  looking towards the Mossville skyline. They pushed through the crowd
  towards the spot beneath the apex of the Suction-Flux
  Hydro-Debogilator in the midst of the broad muddy expanse between the
  ridge and Mossville.</p>
  <p>
  	It was Valerie who saw him
  first.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Theo!” she shouted. She
  ran toward a gentle slope of mud beyond the edge of the crowd. Rudy
  and the others followed her.</p>
  <p>
  	Theo lay on his back, embedded
  in the soft earth. His mouth was open and his eyes were closed. He
  was not moving. Valerie fell to her knees beside him and put her ear
  close to his nose and mouth. No breath came. She pressed her fingers
  to his neck and collapsed in sobs.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Rudy also rushed to Theo's
  side. He touched Theo's neck and face. There was no sign of a pulse.</p>
  <p>
  	“Son!” he shouted.</p>
  <p>
  	Theo was still as a stone.
  Rudy buried his head in his hands. “Theo!”</p>
  <p>
  	Pythagoras watched from a few
  yards away. His face was stern but his eyes welled up with tears.
  </p>
  <p>
  	A small group of onlookers
  from both Mossville and Kook Bog had gathered around the group. They
  watched silently.
  </p>
  <p>
  	A faint buzzing sound came
  from behind a cluster of onlookers. The small crowd parted to let Bea
  through and others turned to look at her.
  </p>
  <p>
  	She was covered with mud and
  her purple dress was in tatters. Her porcelain head was badly chipped
  and cracked. She staggered weakly, close to collapse with every step.
  Her bugs were disorderly and sparse, and her limbs fluctuated between
  holding their positions and drifting limply. At moments her body
  seemed to float aimlessly between steps. She gripped a clump of
  flowers in her hands.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Valerie watched wordlessly as
  Bea approached and laid the clump of flowers on Theo's chest. Tears
  streamed down Valerie's face.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Bea knelt beside Theo and took
  one of the flowers from his chest. She peeled the leaves off of its
  stem, then crushed the leaves in her fingers until they were just a
  moist green powder that caked her fingers. Then she thrust her
  fingers deeply into Theo's mouth.</p>
  <p>
  	Rudy started forward to pull
  the strange creature from his son, but Valerie raised her hand to
  stop him. She stared at Bea intently. The tear stains on her cheeks
  had begun to dry. Something was happening.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Bea took another flower from
  Theo's chest. She pulled several stamens from the flower. She pushed
  them each as far up Theo's nostrils as she could and brushed them
  around, spreading their dust throughout his nasal cavity.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Rudy watched with growing
  fascination.
  </p>
  <p>
  	From the next flower, Bea
  pulled the pistil and squeezed its base until a fine clear liquid
  dripped out. She let several drops fall into each of Theo's eyes.
  </p>
  <p>
  	She pulled open Theo's shirt.
  She took the petals from the last flower and rubbed them into the
  skin of Theo's neck and chest.
  </p>
  <p>
  	A deeper buzzing sound became
  audible. Rudy looked up to see a cloud of bugs approaching.</p>
  <p>
  	All at once, the bugs
  descended upon Theo. They covered his head and flew in thick, rapid
  clouds into his nose and mouth. They circulated into his ears and
  clustered around the slits of his his closed eyes, creating a thick
  green eyeshadow of aphids.</p>
  <p>
  	The cloud of bugs pushed
  further into his nose and mouth and his chest rose. The cloud emerged
  rapidly from his nose and mouth and his chest went down. The aphids
  pushed his eyes open slowly. His eyes stared blankly into the sky.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Again, the cloud of bugs
  pushed into and out of his mouth, raising and lowering his chest.
  Bugs continued to course into and out of his ears and nose.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The bugs surrounded him
  completely, raising him out of the mud and lifting his torso a few
  inches above the ground.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Suddenly, Theo's eyes focused.
  His body thrashed and he coughed violently. The bugs dropped him to
  the ground with a thud and he rolled onto his hands and knees,
  clutching at his chest. He coughed a cloud of gnats and tried to wipe
  the bugs from his eyes, nose, and mouth. He gagged and spit and
  sneezed, and tears streamed down his red face.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Eventually the last of the
  bugs left him. He slumped onto his side, leaning up on one arm and
  heaving for breath. He looked around.</p>
  <p>
  	Valerie, Rudy and Pythagoras
  stared wide-eyed, along with the rest of the onlookers. Nobody moved
  a muscle for a long, long moment.</p>
  <p>
  	Upon a stone a few yards away
  a family of toads watched the scene with what appeared to be great
  interest.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The villagers of Kook Bog
  continued to spill over the ridge and into Mossville city limits. The
  sun shone brightly all around.
