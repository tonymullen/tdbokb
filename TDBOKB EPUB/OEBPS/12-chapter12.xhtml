  	A lot of things in Rudy's workshop were not within easy reach for Theo.
  On the highest shelf against the wall over the workbench, among
  bottles of screws and fasteners, Theo spotted what he was looking
  for: a brown glass jar with a worn masking tape label across it that
  read <em>BOBBY PINS</em>.</p>
  <p>
  	Valerie had been right about
  one thing. It was a good idea to get the handcuffs off as soon as
  possible. Theo still expected Rudy to return home at any moment, with
  apologies for his absentmindedness and a perfectly reasonable
  explanation for where he'd been. Theo didn't think his own status as
  a fugitive from the law needed to be the first thing they talked
  about.</p>
  <p>
  	Theo climbed onto the
  workbench and reached for the bottle. The shelf was just a bit too
  high. He strained, placing his other hand on a lower shelf to give
  himself a boost.
  </p>
  <p>
  	That was a mistake.</p>
  <p>
  	The lower shelf gave way under
  his weight. The shelf pivoted on its bracket and the far end swung
  up. Bottles of powders and goop sailed into the air and crashed down
  around Theo as he tumbled to the floor. A jar of deep pink leonore
  extract smashed against the corner of the workbench and splattered
  all over Theo.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Spilled leonore extract! Theo
  acted quickly. The window of the workshop was open. Theo dashed over
  and slammed it shut. He pushed rags against the cracks around the
  frames, to keep the scent of the leonore from escaping.
  </p>
  <p>
  	He grabbed a mop and a canvas
  sack and hastily set to work getting the messed cleaned up.</p>
  <p>
  	When Theo had stuffed the last
  of many pungent, sopping rags into the bag he pulled the drawstring
  shut, wrapped the bag up in blankets and buried it in the bottom of
  an old trunk in the corner of the workshop.
  </p>
  <p>
  	He looked at the handcuff
  around his wrist. The leonore extract had hardened and darkened to a
  deep maroon. They keyhole, hinges, and latch areas were caked thick
  and solid with the substance.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Oh, great,” said Theo to
  himself. He'd need more than a bobby pin for this.
  </p>
  <p>
  	He wrapped a rag tightly
  around his wrist, concealing the handcuffs. This would have to do for
  now.</p>
  <p>
  	He went to the window and
  peeked out. The air around the house was clear.
  </p>

  	Ballhatchet and Dooley walked
  together up the tree-lined country road towards the Promovendis
  house.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“What I have in mind is
  this,” said Ballhatchet. “We knock on the door and talk in a
  little old lady voice and say we're selling jam.”</p>
  <p >
  	“Why would we do that?”
  said Dooley.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“To gain the element of
  surprise, of course,” said Ballhatchet. “Wouldn't you be
  surprised if you opened the door thinking you were going to get some
  jam and saw the two of us?”</p>
  <p >
  	“I don't see why we have to
  say anything,” said Dooley. “we just knock on the door and grab
  the kid when he answers.”</p>
  <p >
  	“Well, what if he says
  'Who's there?'” said Ballhatchet.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Then we kick the door in
  and grab him,” said Dooley.</p>
  <p >
  	“We'd blow our cover doing
  that,” said Ballhatchet. “Little old ladies can't kick doors in.”</p>
  <p >
  	Dooley shot Ballhatchet an
  irritated look.
  </p>
  <p >
  	When they reached the house,
  the door was open and nobody was in.

  <p>
  	Cess
  returned to the patent office in a foul mood, the odd gnat still
  emerging here and there from the folds of his clothing. What he saw
  at the office did nothing to improve his spirits.</p>
  <p>
  	A picket line had formed in
  front of the patent office. The clerks marched back and forth
  carrying signs with disgruntled messages. “On Strike,” and “Give
  Us A Raise,” read the signs.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Wonderful,” growled Cess
  as he stormed through the picket line.
  </p>
  <p>
  	He met Felix in the waiting area
  of the patent office. Felix was carrying a tray of cups of coffee. A
  handful of patent applicants sat waiting for their interviews.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Who's behind all this?”
  demanded Cess.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Felix took a deep breath.</p>
  <p>
  	“I am, sir,” he said. “I
  think it's about time we had a raise.”</p>
  <p>
  	“A raise? About time?”
  Cess stared at Felix as though the words were entirely foreign.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Sir, I've shown you the
  numbers,” Felix said, trying hard to keep his voice steady. “We
  may not be worth much to you, but we've got mouths to feed.”
  </p>
  <p>
  	“So what does all this
  mean?” said Cess, gesturing contemptuously towards the picket line.
  “You're not going to work? What about these people? Not a thought
  for them?”</p>
  <p>
  	Cess pointed to the disheveled
  collection of oddballs sitting in the waiting area, clutching their
  stacks of devices and plans.</p>
  <p>
  	“We realize it's an
  inconvenience,” said Felix.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Cess spun on his heel and
  spoke into the face of a thickly bearded applicant.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“You! What do you do for a
  living?” he demanded.</p>
  <p>
  	“Me?” said the applicant,
  jarred from a daydream. “Uh, I hope one day to market my
  head-mounted mechanical toothpick. At the moment I sleep in a
  municipal bicycle shed to keep costs down.”</p>
  <p>
  	“How would you like to work
  in the fast-paced, thrilling world of patent administration?” said
  Cess.</p>
  <p>
  	“I suppose it's worth a
  try,” said the applicant.</p>
  <p>
  	Cess turned to Felix.</p>
  <p>
  	“Meet your replacement,”
  he said. “You're fired. And on your way out tell that gaggle of
  reprobates out there they've got thirty seconds to reclaim their
  seats.”</p>
  <p>
  	Felix's jaw dropped. Cess
  stepped into the elevator.</p>
  <p>
  	“Mouths to feed!” he spat.

  <p>
  	In
  the secret shelter, Theo watched nervously as Valerie carried on a
  one-sided conversation with his creation.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Can you talk?” said
  Valerie. “My name is Valerie. Can you say Valerie?”</p>
  <p>
  	“It can't talk,” said
  Theo.</p>
  <p>
  	“<em>She</em>
  can't talk,” corrected Valerie. “We had a deal. And anyway, how
  do you know?”</p>
  <p >
  	“Fine, she can't talk,”
  said Theo. “I know because I built it... her.”</p>
  <p >
  	Valerie took a bow from her
  hair and dangled it in front of Bea.</p>
  <p >
  	“Do you like toys?” she
  said.
  </p>
  <p >
  	The bugs swarming around Bea's
  head reacted to the movement of the bow. A ripple of movement
  percolated through the swarm and made its way to Bea's eyes and neck.
  Bea's head followed the movement of the bow.</p>
  <p >
  	“Look,” cried Valerie,
  “she sees it!”</p>
  <p >
  	Theo watched. Indeed, Bea's
  flickering gaze appeared to follow the bow. Her mechanical hand
  twitched.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Valerie swung the bow back and
  forth. Bea's head turned in jerky, uncertain movements.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“She's trying to follow it,”
  said Valerie.</p>
  <p>
  	It
  seemed so. Theo felt a rush of excitement. There was no doubt Valerie
  had a way with the automaton——with <em>Bea</em>.
  Valerie was bringing out behavior Theo had only seen hints of up till
  now.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Bea's hand quivered, half
  extended.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Look,” said Valerie. “She
  wants to hold it!”
  </p>
  <p >
  	Theo looked skeptical. Bea's
  arm swayed.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Yes, see?” said Valerie.
  “She's trying to grab it.”</p>
  <p >
  	Valerie reached forward to
  help. She took Bea's wrist in her hand.</p>
  <p >
  	“Like this,” said Valerie.</p>
  <p >
  	Theo saw the bugs react before
  he could even make a sound.</p>
  <p >
  	“Don't!” he shouted.</p>
  <p >
  	It was too late. A hornet
  broke free of the swarm and landed on Valerie's hand. It thrust its
  stinger into the flesh of her thumb.
  </p>

  <p>
  	A stone's throw down the hill,
  Ballhatchet and Dooley poked around the Promovendis house. Strangely,
  it seemed as if somebody had already ransacked the house before them.

  </p>
  <p>
  	“My theory in a situation
  like this is you think, 'where would I be if I was the thing I was
  looking for?'” Ballhatchet ventured.</p>
  <p>
  	“Okay, then,” said Dooley.
  “Where would you be?”</p>
  <p>
  	“Well, I'd be trying to
  hide,” said Ballhatchet. “But I can't think of any good places.
  If it was me we'd have probably found me already.”</p>
  <p>
  	“That's a real helpful
  theory, Ballhatchet,” said Dooley.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I never said it was a
  silver bullet,” said Ballhatchet.
  </p>
  <p>
  	They looked around the house
  halfheartedly. There was a whole lot of junk, but nothing very
  interesting. They opened cupboards and closets and checked under the
  beds.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“My theory is there's nobody
  here,” said Dooley.</p>
  <p>
  	Ballhatchet shrugged. They
  turned to leave.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Just then a scream pierced the
  air.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Moments later, Ballhatchet and
  Dooley crouched in the woods just off the path. Their view into the
  secret shelter was obscured by leaves and branches, but they could
  see the children clearly enough.</p>
  <p>
  	“We got him!” whispered
  Ballhatchet.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Not so fast,” said
  Dooley. “You see who that is?”</p>
  <p>
  	It took a moment for
  Ballhatchet to place the face. When he did, his eyes widened with
  surprise.</p>
  <p>
  	The boy was holding the
  Digniggleby girl's hand. She was sobbing.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“What's he doing to her?”
  he said.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I don't know,” said
  Dooley. “Hang on...”</p>
  <p>
  	Both the children looked
  towards a corner of the shelter that was out of sight from where
  Ballhatchet and Dooley were.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Is there someone else
  there?” wondered Dooley.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The boy took a spoonful of
  powder from a jar. He reached cautiously with the spoon towards the
  hidden corner of the shelter, extending his arm as far as he could
  reach. He shook out the contents of the spoon and stepped back.</p>
  <p>
  	“He's cooking something!”
  whispered Ballhatchet.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I don't think so,” said
  Dooley.</p>
  <p>
  	The two children stared at the
  corner of the shelter.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Something shiny and metallic
  moved into view. Ballhatchet and Dooley squinted to make out what it
  was. In a moment it was clear. It was a mechanical hand. The hand
  extended smoothly towards the children.</p>
  <p>
  	The two children looked at
  each other. They seemed surprised. The boy nodded to the Digniggleby
  girl, who slowly extended her own hand. She held a large purple bow.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Ballhatchet and Dooley gasped
  at what they saw next. The owner of the mechanical hand leaned
  forward into view. It reached out and gently took the bow.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Holy-——Ballhatchet, are
  you seeing what I'm seeing?” said Dooley.</p>
  <p>
  	“I'm seeing something
  weird,” said Ballhatchet.</p>
  <p>
  	“That thing isn't human, is
  it,” said Dooley.</p>
  <p>
  	“I don't think so,” said
  Ballhatchet.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“We gotta tell Mr. Cess
  about this,” said Dooley.	</p>
  <p>
  	“Why don't we just grab 'em
  all?” said Ballhatchet.</p>
  <p>
  	“Are you crazy? That's the
  mayor's kid!” said Dooley. “We gotta have a delicate touch here.”</p>
  <p>
  	Dooley squinted again in the
  direction of the secret shelter. He looked around to be sure not to
  forget the spot.</p>
  <p>
  	“We know where they are
  now,” he said. “Let's get back.”</p>
  <p>
  	A short while later, the two
  of them sat in Cess's office and tried to explain what they had seen.

  </p>
  <p>
  	“A <em>baby</em>?”
  said Cess.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Like some kind of robot, or
  a puppet or something,” said Dooley.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“With those bugs you like!”
  interjected Ballhatchet. “Like the toaster thing from the
  demonstration.”</p>
  <p>
  	Cess did not conceal his
  irritation.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Firstly, I don't especially
  like the bugs,” he said. “Secondly, it was not a toaster.”</p>
  <p>
  	“It was kind of hard to tell
  what it was, sir,” said Ballhatchet.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Ballhatchet, how about you
  just shut up,” said Dooley. Then to Cess he said, “I made the
  call to wait and get the kid and the thing later.”</p>
  <p>
  	“So you did,” said Cess.
  </p>
  <p>
  	He had to admit his curiosity
  was piqued.
  </p>

  <div class='break'>
    <img class='break' alt='&sect;' src='bug2.png'></img>
  </div>

  <p>
  	In the living room of the
  Mayoral Mansion Cynthia Digniggleby sat, disheveled and welted with
  bug bites. She slapped an itch on her wrist repeatedly.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“That man is a <em>menace</em>!”
  she said. “You see what he's trying to do, don't you?”</p>
  <p>
  	Mayor Digniggleby wanted very
  much to comfort his wife, but he wasn't especially good at it. He
  stood stiffly a few feet away and gently petted the air with one hand
  to calm her.</p>
  <p>
  	“I, uh, Cynthia sweetheart—”
  he began. “Uh, no. What's he trying to do?”</p>
  <p>
  	“He's trying to take over
  your position!” she exclaimed. “Isn't it obvious? You became the
  mayor because the people were grateful for your invention! Now he's
  trying to upstage you with that vile bug contraption!”</p>
  <p>
  	“Now, that's not a very
  charitable way of looking at it,” said Digniggleby. “Mr. Cess has
  always supported me.”</p>
  <p>
  	“Supported you indeed,”
  seethed Cynthia. “Like a tent-pole! When will you get a spine of
  your own?”</p>
  <p>
  	At that moment, Valerie walked
  in the front door. Cynthia leaped up and raced over to hug her.</p>
  <p>
  	“Darling! I'm so glad you're
  home!” said Cynthia. “I've been positively distracted with
  worry!”</p>
  <p>
  	“I want a new doll,” said
  Valerie.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Why, of course, honey,”
  said Cynthia.</p>
  <p>
  	“I want to pick it myself,”
  said Valerie.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Cynthia shot Digniggleby one
  more angry look.</p>
  <p>
  	“Let's go shopping right
  now, honey,” she said to Valerie. “Daddy has work to do.”</p>
