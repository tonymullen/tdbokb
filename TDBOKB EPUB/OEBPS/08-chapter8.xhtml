  <p>
  	The
  home of Baron Llewellyn LePeen was a stately manor built in the
  neoclassical style and painted a dusty rose color that the baron was
  extremely fond of. The inside of the manor was ornate and reflected
  the baron's refined taste. The salon where the baron now sat with
  Mayor Digniggleby and Mr. Cess was predominantly the same dusty rose
  color of the outside of the building. The room was adorned with
  gorgeous neoclassical panels of deep purple venetian plaster on the
  wall and a trompe l'oeil fresco on the ceiling featuring several
  dozen fat, winged cherubs who appeared to float upward over the room
  towards an overflowing pot of gold that hovered——literally at the
  end of a rainbow——in the sky above. The furniture in the salon
  was deep reddish walnut with brass fixtures.</p>
  <p>
  	Mayor Digniggleby and Mr. Cess
  sat on chairs with maroon velvet cushions while the baron reclined
  across a small table from them in his stocking feet atop a matching
  chaise longue.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“So, you want to buy my
  land,” said the baron.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Mayor Digniggleby nodded.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Yes, that's right,” he
  said.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The baron waved a finger in
  the air.</p>
  <p>
  	“Bartholomew!” he called.</p>
  <p>
  	A butler appeared immediately,
  as if out of nowhere.	</p>
  <p>
  	“Two glasses of wine
  please,” said the baron. He glanced at Mr. Cess, who sat hunched
  and glowering in his drab colored suit. “And a cup of coffee for
  the clerk.”</p>
  <p>
  	Cess stiffened. The baron
  smiled widely at him.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“We need you to be attentive
  to the details, after all!” said the baron jovially. 	</p>
  <p>
  	The baron now turned back to
  Mayor Digniggleby.</p>
  <p>
  	“So then. You see, the thing
  is,” he said, “I have a great many sheep.”</p>
  <p>
  	He turned to Cess.</p>
  <p>
  	“Four hundred and
  sixty-two,” he enunciated.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Mr. Cess's pocket sized
  reel-to-reel recording device turned quietly on the table between
  them.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Indeed,” said Mayor
  Digniggleby.</p>
  <p>
  	“So I don't think I'm
  interested,” said the baron.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I see,” said Mayor
  Digniggleby.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Mr. Cess leaned over and
  whispered into Mayor Digniggleby's ear. Mayor Digniggleby's forehead
  wrinkled worriedly and his jowls trembled.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Uhh,” said Mayor
  Digniggleby.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Bartholomew appeared with two
  glasses of wine and a cup of coffee on a silver tray. He placed the
  wine in front of the baron and Mayor Digniggleby and the coffee in
  front of Cess. Cess looked disdainfully at the coffee. The baron
  raised his wine glass to Mayor Digniggleby, who reluctantly raised
  his own in response.</p>
  <p>
  	“Cheers!” said the baron.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Mayor Digniggleby downed his
  wine in a gulp.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“So I suppose we're finished
  here then!” said the Baron. He turned to Cess. “Please send a
  transcript of your notes to my secretary by the end of the work week.
  I'm sure I can count on you to be thorough!”</p>
  <p>
  	“Well,” said Mayor
  Digniggleby timidly.</p>
  <p>
  	“Yes?” said the baron.</p>
  <p>
  	“There was one other thing I
  had, uh, hoped to bring up,” said Mayor Digniggleby. He looked
  around. “But I suppose maybe I——”</p>
  <p>
  	He cleared his throat. Then he
  coughed. His eyes watered.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The baron raised his eyebrows.</p>
  <p>
  	“Never mind,” said Mayor
  Digniggleby, wincing visibly under Cess's furious glare.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Mr. Cess was still fuming as
  they left the baron's manor.</p>
  <p>
  	“I just couldn't threaten
  him,” said Digniggleby. “After his hospitality and whatnot.”</p>
  <p>
  	Cess said nothing.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Sorry about the coffee,”
  said Mayor Digniggleby.</p>
  <p>
  	Cess stared straight ahead.
  </p>
  <p >

<p>
  	It was like a curse, thought
  Cess. To have so much power within his grasp and yet all at the mercy
  of this incompetent buffoon. It was the only drawback of what had
  once been such a perfect plan, but what a ruinous drawback it was.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Cess remembered the day it had
  all begun. It was in the midst of Mossville's darkest times; the
  catastrophe was in an advanced stage and advancing mercilessly with
  each passing day. People went about their daily business, some
  feigning ignorance, some mutely ignoring the encroaching horror as if
  willing the reality to become unreal. But everyone knew the truth
  deep down. Mossville was helpless, sinking like a drowning rat.  	</p>
  <p>
  	The patent office was much the
  same then. Except, of course, there was no elevator, nor any place
  above for an elevator to go.
  </p>
  <p>
  	In those days, Cess was a
  young man. He had never been an especially robust person, but he
  stood without hunching and he still had most of his brown hair,
  thinning though it may have been.</p>
  <p>
  	Cess's desk was just one among
  the sea of desks in the patent office. He was responsible for
  receiving   applications. Day after day he took applications, engaged
  applicants in a brief interview, and sent the paperwork on its way.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“You should be hearing from
  our office within the next eight to twenty-four weeks,” he said
  hundreds of times a day. “Please do not contact our office until
  you have received notice.”</p>
  <p>
  	The clerk to Cess's left was
  named Barlow. Barlow was a bit unkempt and prone to mistakes, but
  friendly and good-natured.
  </p>
  <p>
  	An applicant left Barlow's
  desk and Barlow turned to Cess.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“There's an idea that'll
  make him rich,” said Barlow. “Powdered whiskey.”</p>
  <p>
  	Cess glanced at Barlow. He
  didn't mind Barlow. Sure, Barlow was basically a waste of space who
  would never accomplish anything of any importance and was doomed to
  toil away in soul-crushing tedium just like all the rest of the
  clerks. But as wastes-of-space went, Barlow was bearable, and
  occasionally even showed hints of spunk.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Y'know,” said Barlow more
  quietly. “Sometimes I think it sure would be tempting to just,
  y'know, take one of these ideas. I mean, there are so many of them!
  Who'd be the wiser? But then, I suppose straight arrows like Felix
  run such a tight ship around here that none of us could get away with
  something like that.”</p>
  <p>
  	Barlow gestured idly at the
  desk across the room where the neatly-combed, bespectacled Felix sat,
  diligently organizing papers and checking stamps and signatures.
  Felix's desk was impeccably tidy.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I suppose not,” said
  Cess. He paused a moment before returning to his work. “Next!”</p>
  <p>
  	It had been that very day that
  Pythagoras Promovendis had taken his seat across from Cess's desk and
  presented his application.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Pythagoras was even more
  furtive and cagey than the average patent-seeker. His eyes darted
  back and forth as he passed the stack of forms and plans across the
  cluttered desktop. Written in the “Invention Name” field of the
  main application form were the words “Suction-Flux
  Hydro-Debogilator.” Cess looked over the form and skimmed the
  plans. 	</p>
  <p>
  	“What does it do?” he
  said.</p>
  <p>
  	“It will reverse the advance
  of the bog,” said Pythagoras.</p>
  <p>
  	Cess pricked up his ears. The
  fingers of his left hand unconsciously scratched at he caked mud that
  covered his pant legs nearly up to the knees. It was the same mud
  that covered everyone's trousers in Mossville. He wondered for a
  moment how it could have been so easy for so many people to grow
  accustomed to trudging through three feet of mud wherever they went.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Reverse?” said Cess.</p>
  <p>
  	“It will save this city,”
  said Pythagoras.</p>
  <p>
  	“That would certainly be
  something,” said Cess.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Yes,” said Pythagoras.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Cess looked over the
  submission form more closely. Everything seemed to be in place. He
  slid the form towards Pythagoras and pointed to the space for the
  inventor's signature.</p>
  <p>
  	“I need you to sign here,”
  he said.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Pythagoras moved forward to
  sign. Suddenly, the entire room tilted sickeningly. Items tumbled
  from the shelves and clerks gripped their desks. Shifts like these
  had become a daily feature of life in Mossville lately.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Pythagoras fixed Cess with
  wide, wild eyes.</p>
  <p>
  	“There is no time to waste!”
  he said.</p>
  <p>
  	“Indeed!” said a shaken
  Cess.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Pythagoras signed his name
  rapidly, still staring at Cess, as if to further impress upon him the
  importance of the application.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“You should be hearing from
  our office in the next,” Cess's voice trailed off, “eight to
  twenty-four weeks.”</p>
  <p>
  	“This town should be so
  lucky to still be standing then,” hissed Pythagoras.</p>
  <p>
  	Cess nodded.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I'll do what I can,” he
  said.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Cess sat quietly for a moment
  after Pythagoras had left. He knew it was true. The invention was
  Mossville's only hope, at a time when hope was exactly what the city
  needed.
  </p>
  <p>
  	He set the Promovendis
  application in his out box and was about to call the next applicant
  when he noticed something. The inventor's signature was not on the
  application.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Puzzled, Cess ruffled through
  the papers on his desk to see if somehow he had gotten two copies of
  the application form. He quickly found the culprit: a blank sheet of
  typing paper, across the top edge of which was the freshly scrawled
  signature of Pythagoras Promovendis. The sheet of paper must have
  slid across the form when the ground had shifted. Without noticing,
  Pythagoras had signed his name to the wrong paper.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Instinctively, Cess rose from
  his chair and made to chase Pythagoras, but he stopped himself.
  Perhaps, he thought to himself, now was not the time to do anything
  hasty. He sat back down slowly.
  </p>
  <p>
  	He looked again at the
  unsigned form, then tucked it into his desk drawer.</p>
  <p>
  	“Next!” he said.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Later that evening, Cess sat
  in his desk doing paperwork as his colleagues left the office one by
  one.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Felix passed his desk.</p>
  <p>
  	“Don't overtax yourself!”
  said Felix.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Cess smiled vaguely.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Just a few things I need to
  finish up,” he said.</p>
  <p>
  	When the last clerk had left
  Cess sat alone in the  light of his desk lamp. He took the
  Promovendis application out of the desk and stared at it for a long
  time.
