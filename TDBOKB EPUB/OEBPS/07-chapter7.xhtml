</p>

  <p>
  	The
  morning was crisp and bright as Rudy walked down the wooded path from
  the house to fetch the mail. It had been months since any mail had
  arrived, and months longer than that since Rudy had originally
  submitted the application for his patent. He knew the bureaucracy
  took time, but it was becoming difficult to hold out hope of ever
  receiving a reply.
  </p>
  <p>
  	So it was with great
  excitement that he found the officious looking letter in the mailbox
  with the return address stamped in authoritative capital letters:
  <em>MOSSVILLE MUNICIPAL
  OFFICE OF PATENT REGISTRATION AND PROCESSING</em>.
  A gleeful squeal emerged from Rudy's throat and he instinctively
  glanced around to see if anybody had heard him. He had to fight just
  to keep from jumping in the air and clicking his heels. He bounced
  slightly as he tore the envelope open and unfolded the contents.</p>
  <p>
  	It was his original patent
  application. Running diagonally across the page in huge red letters,
  the word <em>REJECTED</em>
  was stamped. He stopped bouncing.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Folded behind the application
  was a letter. The letter read:</p>
  <p>
  	<em>Dear
  Inventor,</em></p>
  <p>
  	<em>We
  regret to inform you that your patent application has been rejected.</em>

  </p>
  <p>
  				<em>Best
  Regards,</em></p>
  <p>
  				<em>Horace
  E. Cess</em>

  </p>
  <p>
  				<em>Chief
  Patent Administrator, MMOPRP</em></p>
  <p>
  	Tears
  welled up in Rudy's eyes. He stood on the path for a long time.
  </p>
<p>
  <div class='break'>
    <img class='break' src='bug7.png'></img>
  </div>
</p>
<p>
  	The main office area of the
  Mossville patent office consisted of a single, sprawling, windowless
  room. Most of the surfaces had been painted pale slate gray many
  years previously in order to minimize distractions for the workers,
  and the paint job showed its age. Rows and rows of modest wooden
  desks stretched to the back of the room, each equipped with a
  typewriter, a wooden rack of rubber stamps, a deep wooden in-box at
  the left corner, and a deep, wooden out-box at the right corner. At
  each desk a gray-clad patent office employee worked diligently on his
  or her paperwork. The uniform of patent office workers consisted of a
  light gray shirt, dark gray slacks and tie for men and dark gray
  skirt and sailor scarf for women.
  </p>
  <p>
  	In the center of the room
  stood an elevator. The elevator had clearly been constructed as an
  afterthought, added to the original building with little if any
  planning. Iron pulleys, cables, gears and flywheels stood exposed,
  looking entirely out of place——and more than a little
  hazardous——against the austere background of the room.
  </p>
  <p>
  	At the front and center of the
  room, between the rows of desks and the public entrance, stood
  another desk with a placard that read <em>RECEPTION</em>.
  On this desk sat a rusty intercom. A uniformed office lady sat behind
  this desk.
  </p>
  <p >
  	To the left of the public
  entrance, facing the reception desk, stood a long row of wooden
  chairs. Rudy sat in one of these chairs. Other somewhat unkempt
  middle-aged men sat to either side of him. All of them, including
  Rudy, looked nervous and ill-at-ease.
  </p>
  <p >
  	A man's voice came through the
  intercom, barking a curt order. From where Rudy sat there was far too
  much distortion to make out exactly what the voice said. The
  receptionist responded quietly into the intercom, then raised her
  head.</p>
  <p >
  	“Promovendis,” she said.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Yes, that's me,” said
  Rudy.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“The Chief Patent
  Administrator will see you now,” she said.
  </p>
  <p >
  	The elevator doors behind the
  receptionist opened. She gestured for Rudy to enter.</p>
  <p >
  	“You're awfully fortunate,
  Mr. Promovendis,” she said as he passed her desk. “Mr. Cess
  rarely meets personally with claimants.”
  </p>
  <p >
  	The elevator ride was as
  rickety and harrowing on the inside as the elevator looked on the
  outside. Rudy stepped out of the elevator considerably more rattled
  than he had been going in. He found himself in the middle of a
  cluttered, dimly-lit office.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Seated in a high-backed
  leather chair behind a large desk was the Chief Patent Administrator.

  </p>
  <p >
  	 “Don't trouble yourself to
  sit down,” said Mr. Cess. “This shouldn't take long. What can I
  do for you?”</p>
  <p >
  	Rudy reached timidly across
  the desk and handed his rejected application to Mr. Cess.</p>
  <p >
  	“I... this... I think there
  must be some mistake,” he stammered.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Cess glanced at the
  application, then tossed it on the desk.</p>
  <p >
  	“I see,” he said.</p>
  <p >
  	“I need the patent to
  protect my work,” said Rudy.</p>
  <p >
  	Mr. Cess pressed his
  fingertips together and looked upward, as though pondering how best
  to explain a difficult concept.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Well, you see, I'm afraid
  that's the problem,” he said. “Patents can only be granted to
  original works.”</p>
  <p >
  	“B-but,” protested Rudy,
  “the invention is unprecedented! And the mechanisms can be
  generalized to create an endless variety of devices. I'm going to
  change the world with these technologies! How could anybody think
  this is not worthy of a patent?”</p>
  <p >
  	Mr. Cess looked Rudy in the
  eye.</p>
  <p >
  	“Oh, it is worthy of a
  patent,” he said. He reached down and withdrew a rolled up set of
  plans from a pile of similar rolls behind his desk. He slowly
  unrolled the plans and spread them out across the desk.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Unfortunately, someone
  seems to have beaten you to it,” he said.
  </p>
  <p >
  	There, diagrammed in precise
  detail, complete with with measurements and annotations, was Rudy's
  harvester. The handwriting was his, the drawings were the very ones
  he had labored over for years. Every component, every mechanism,
  every brilliant idea he had had over the course of the past two
  decades was there in those plans.</p>
  <p >
  	Across the top of the page,
  the words “Promovendis Insect-Powered Hillside Harvester” could
  still be made out. But the name on the plans had been awkwardly
  altered with what looked like tempera paint to read “CESS”.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The
  plans were stamped with large green stamps reading <em>APPROVED</em>.</p>
  <p >
  	“I don't understand,”
  gasped Rudy. “That's my... How... Who?”</p>
  <p >
  	“I suppose great minds think
  alike,” said Cess.</p>
  <p >
  	Rudy stood motionless,
  confused and shocked beyond words.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“I'd be very interested to
  know who, aside from yourself, has been party to this unfortunate
  miscommunication,” said Cess.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Rudy blinked
  uncomprehendingly, mouthing Cess's words to himself to try and make
  them make sense.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Who else knows about the
  machine?” asked Cess.</p>
  <p >
  	“Who else knows?” said
  Rudy in a daze. “Why, nobody. Just me and my s——,”</p>
  <p >
  	Rudy stopped himself, but it
  was too late. A terrible understanding began to creep over him. This
  was no miscommunication.</p>
  <p >
  	Cess leaned forward.</p>
  <p >
  	“Your son?” he said.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Now hold on,” said Rudy.
  “You leave my son out of this. He is not involved in my work in any
  way.”</p>
  <p >
  	Cess smiled agreeably. “Of
  course not.”</p>
  <p >
  	Rudy looked around the office.
  On the desk the reels of the patent administrator's pocket-sized
  reel-to-reel recording device turned quietly.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“I don't know what's going
  on here,” he said. “But if you're trying to steal my invention,
  you won't get away with it!”</p>
  <p >
  	Cess stood.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“My dear man,” he said.
  “There's no need for talk like that. Here, come this way. I have
  something to show you that I think will render this little dispute
  quite beside the point.”</p>
  <p >
  	“Show me?” said Rudy.</p>
  <p>
  	Cess
  walked to a wood door at the side of his study and opened it. It
  opened out onto a small platform from which a rather magnificent view
  of Mossville city center could be seen. At the far edge of the
  platform was a vertical steel pole which rose beyond the view of the
  door. On the pole hung a wooden sign shaped like the outline of a
  hand with the index finger extended pointing away from the city. The
  sign read <em>KOOK
  BOG</em>.</p>
  <p >
  	“Step this way please,”
  said Cess, gesturing towards the balcony.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Still shocked and confused,
  and now increasingly curious, Rudy stepped out onto the platform. He
  looked out over the breathtaking scene.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Cess
  pressed a large red button on the wall. The label of the button read
  <em>KOOK BOG
  GONDOLA LAUNCH</em>.

  </p>
  <p >
  	Suddenly, the Kook Bog Gondola
  roared to life. Rudy looked up to see the bullwheel at the top of the
  pole start to turn and the overhead cables jerk into motion. It took
  him just a moment to understand the significance of these movements,
  but it was a moment too long.
  </p>
  <p >
  	The gondola itself was an
  angled wooden bucket at the end of a metal pole. It swung down to the
  platform and scooped Rudy up in a flash, catching him by the rear end
  and wedging him in tightly as it sailed  upward along its cable and
  away into the misty yonder.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Rudy's screams faded into the
  distance. Cess watched him go with an expression of grim
  satisfaction.
  </p>
<p>
  <div class='break'>
    <img class='break' src='bug8.png'></img>
  </div>
</p>
<p>
  	Many years previously a very
  young Horace Cess had decided what he wanted to be when he grew up.
  At the time, he lived in a large orphanage in the outskirts of
  Greater Mossville County. He had lived there as far back as he could
  remember, ever since——he had been told——his parents had been
  killed by an alligator while picnicking. If not for his father's
  slide-rule becoming stuck in the beast's craw, Baby Horace too would
  surely have perished.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Cess remembered as if it were
  yesterday the evening his ten-year-old self sat at the long table in
  the orphanage mess hall staring at the steam rising up from his soup.

  </p>
  <p >
  	The orphan beside him, a boy
  named Geaner, looked at him quizzically.</p>
  <p >
  	“Why are you staring at your
  soup?” said Geaner.</p>
  <p >
  	“I'm studying to be a
  scientist,” said young Cess.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“You can't be a scientist,”
  said Geaner.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Yes I can!” said Cess
  angrily. “I'm going to have a booth in the Mossville Young
  Scientist Fair! And I'm going to win the prize!”</p>
  <p >
  	Geaner just looked at Cess's
  soup.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“I don't see what's
  scientific about soup,” he shrugged.
  </p>
  <p >
  	But young Cess had not been
  dissuaded. Night after night, he waited in his bunk as the lights
  went out in the dormitory of the orphanage, staring at the warped
  plywood of the bunk above him. Through the windows of the dormitory
  he could see the lights go out in other parts of the building. He
  waited until he was sure everybody in the orphanage was fast asleep.
  </p>
  <p >
  	He took a small, tattered
  notebook, a stump of pencil, and a tarnished copper pocket watch from
  under his pillow. Along with the slide-rule, a ladies' boot heel, and
  a piece of belt, the watch had been all that had remained of his
  parents after their fateful marshland picnic.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Young Cess sneaked past the
  bunks of sleeping orphans and out of the dormitory. He made his way
  through the darkened halls of the orphanage until he reached the vast
  kitchen that served all of the orphanage's over five hundred young
  residents.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Every night, he went straight
  to the same corner of the kitchen, where the moon and a dim night
  lamp outside the window cast enough light for him to work. He
  rummaged through a large metal drawer to find a baking thermometer
  and a pan.
  </p>
  <p >
  	He filled the pan with cold
  water from the tap, placed it on the stove, and lit the hob. He
  placed the thermometer into the water, set the watch on the counter,
  and began to take notes. By the time the water boiled, he had filled
  a page with scribbled notes. He dumped the pan out in the sink,
  filled it up again, adjusted the flame on the hob, and repeated the
  process again and again and again.
  </p>
  <p >
  	His research continued in this
  manner for weeks. For all that time, he managed to conceal his
  activities from the adults of the orphanage. He feigned illness to
  explain his lack of sleep. Participation in activities outside the
  orphanage was discouraged in order to prevent orphans from joining
  the circus or embarking on a life of crime. But even if he had
  managed to beg and bargain for permission to participate in the
  science fair, it was strictly forbidden for orphans to enter the
  kitchen under any circumstances. He would have had nothing to
  present.
  </p>
  <p >
  	At last, the day of the
  Mossville Young Scientist Science Fair arrived. Young Cess had
  constructed an elaborate excuse to leave the orphanage for the day.
  His usual Saturday physical education instructor thought he was
  helping the orphanage librarian stack boxes of old books. The
  librarian thought he was running errands for the headmaster of the
  orphanage. The headmaster thought he had been requisitioned by the
  cook to make a trip to the market. The cook knew nothing of any of
  this and wouldn't have recognized Young Cess anyway.
  </p>
  <p >
  	There were at least fifty
  booths set up in the town square and an impressive crowd had gathered
  of parents and relatives of the young scientists.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Young Cess set up his booth by
  himself. It had not been easy to make his poster. He had cut the
  paper to size by hand without scissors (which were forbidden in the
  dormitory area) and had drawn the poster with his pencil stub and
  bits of crayon he had stolen from the orphanage's art room. All of
  this, furthermore, he had done in the dark. He had done his best, but
  the results were far from what anyone could call polished.</p>
  <p>
  	The
  poster featured a series of drawings of pots and water, each
  accompanied by a column of neatly hand-written times and
  temperatures. Across the top of his poster the title was written in
  green crayon: <em>HOW
  WATER BOILS</em>
  with the word “FAST” written in pencil above the rest and
  squeezed in as an afterthought with a little arrow between “HOW”
  and “WATER”. Young Cess had felt that the original title had
  implied a more thorough explanation of the phenomenon than his
  measurements could really provide. Standing before his poster now he
  felt a tinge of regret for his excessive modesty.</p>
  <p >
  	The other exhibits were far
  more sophisticated. To Cess's right a tidy, bespectacled lad stood
  before a presentation titled “The Mating Rituals of the Bonobos”.
  The booth was adorned with expertly-drawn pictures, stunning
  photographs, and tidy, typewritten notes. The centerpiece of the
  presentation was a remarkably lifelike clockwork diorama featuring
  two hand-carved wooden bonobos circling each other and performing
  what looked like dance moves.
  </p>
  <p >
  	To Cess's right, a blonde girl
  in curls presided over an exhibit titled “The Physics of Aviation”,
  which featured beautifully designed poster, a fully-functional
  miniature wind tunnel, and a small armada of tiny working balsa-wood
  flying machines that circled in the air around the presenter.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Other exhibits included a
  clockwork model of the solar system complete with moons, a model
  locomotive that used elecromagnets to levitate over its tracks, and a
  life-sized skeletal replica of the missing link between humans and
  apes.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Family members and loved ones
  thronged around the booths, oohing and aahing over the projects. They
  moved quickly past Cess's booth, avoiding eye contact.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“So sad,” he heard a lady
  say as she passed by. “I don't think they should let them enter. It
  will only make them feel bad.”</p>
  <p >
  	“He's probably the only one
  here who actually made his own project,” said the man she was with.</p>
  <p >
  	“Still, look at it,” said
  the lady. “Poor thing.”</p>
  <p >
  	Cess stood by his poster for
  the duration of the fair, fighting back tears as he looked at the
  other booths and their visitors.
  </p>
  <p >
  	As the crowd began to thin
  later in the day, a rumpled, middle-aged man approached Cess's booth.
  When he looked at Cess directly, Cess stood at attention. Cess had
  spent days preparing his little talk, and was excited to finally have
  a receptive audience.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“I couldn't help but notice
  your notes,” said the man.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Really?” said Cess.</p>
  <p >
  	“I think you have a talent,
  my boy,” said the man.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Cess was dumbstruck. He
  couldn't remember having ever received a compliment of such a
  magnitude.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“A-a talent?” he said.
  “Really?”</p>
  <p >
  	The rumpled man nodded.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“My name is Lobodin,” said
  the man. “I am the headmaster of a clerical school for orphans. I
  think you would be an excellent candidate for enrollment.”</p>
  <p >
  	Cess's excitement disappeared.

  </p>
  <p >
  	“Clerical?” he said.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Your notes are very
  thorough,” smiled Lobodin. “I think you would make an excellent
  clerk.”</p>
  <p >
  	Cess's face darkened.</p>
  <p >
  	“I'm not a clerk,” he
  said. “I'm a scientist.”</p>
  <p >
  	Lobodin looked at Cess's
  poster. He raised his eyebrows in an expression Cess could not help
  but interpret as pity.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“No!” shouted Cess. “I'm
  a scientist! Go away!”</p>
  <p >
  	Lobodin shrugged. He took a
  calling card from a small leather case and slipped it into Cess's
  shirt pocket.</p>
  <p >
  	“If you change your mind,”
  he said. Then, with a friendly smile he turned to leave.</p>
  <p >
  	“I'm not going to change my
  mind!” Cess called after him. “I'm no clerk!”</p>
  <p >
  	Cess took the card from his
  pocket and threw it savagely onto the ground. 	</p>
  <p >
  	“Clerk!” he shouted again.
  His voice cracked and he stifled a sob.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Young Cess's booth had been
  the last one standing that day. He stood there until long after the
  other young scientists and their parents had dismantled theirs. When
  he returned to the orphanage he learned that the physical education
  instructor, the librarian, the headmaster, and the cook happened to
  belong to the same Saturday afternoon Pinochle club and his absence
  had been discovered. He was severely reprimanded and lost privileges
  for a month, but he no longer cared. His dreams had been dashed.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Mr. Cess had never fully
  understood what had made him pick Lobodin's card up from the ground
  and take it with him back to the orphanage. But it had been a fateful
  decision. That card had put him on the path that would one day lead
  him here, to this platform high above Mossville.
  </p>
  <p >
  	He watched the gondola
  disappear into the mist.	</p>
  <p >
  	“Clerk, indeed,” he
  sneered to himself.</p>
  <p >
  	He stepped back into his
  office and closed the door.
  </p>

<p>
  	Buford the toad was sitting
  expectantly in his pen on the windowsill when Theo woke late after a
  night of furtive work on his creation. The little hopper for the
  fungus and fly pheromone was empty. Theo filled it up and left Buford
  to his breakfast.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Rudy was not at home. There
  was nothing unusual about this in the Promovendis house; for the most
  part, father and son came and went as they pleased. Time alone in the
  house was time Theo could devote more freely to his project.
  Especially today, when cutting and drilling the ceramic head to fit
  the machinery was likely to be a noisy process, having the run of the
  place was a welcome surprise.
  </p>
  <p>
  	It was not by chance that
  Rudy's workshop was positioned to afford a clear view down the front
  path of the house. It was one of ways in which Rudy's own paranoia
  often aided Theo in keeping his activities hidden from his father.
  Theo kept one eye on the path as he set to work on the head.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo sheared off the crown of
  the porcelain head. This would give the head mechanism enough room to
  operate and allow free movement of the bugs. He drilled holes in the
  base of the head for the screws to affix the head to the neck. He cut
  a few more small panels from the back of the head to enable access
  for repairs and adjustments. The process took about an hour. He was
  cleaning porcelain powder from the work area when movement caught his
  eye outside the window.</p>
  <p>
  	He ducked down instinctively.
  Through the open window he could hear the voices of two men and their
  heavy footsteps coming up the path. He poked his head up cautiously
  to sneak a look.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Constable Fleabo and another
  officer were approaching the house.
  </p>
  <p>
  	They didn't look happy.
