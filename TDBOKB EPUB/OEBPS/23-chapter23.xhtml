  <p>
  	The
  throbbing hum from the Suction-Flux Hydro-Debogilator had intensified
  to a shrieking roar. The soil around Mossville became steadily drier
  as the monstrous pump pulled the moisture from deep within the
  ground. Cracks appeared between the cobblestones of the town as the
  ground beneath them began to parch.</p>
  <p>
  	In Kook Bog, the roaring mud
  river at the base of the cliffs had become broader and deeper and
  rushed with a foaming ferocity. The swamp beneath the village rose
  rapidly, washing away the lowest walkways and decks. Buildings
  toppled into the mire as the flimsier stilts and pilings snapped like
  twigs against the force of the surging mud. Villagers scrambled to
  the highest decks and climbed upon the swaying roofs.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Cynthia, Digniggleby, Valerie,
  Berke, and Rudy huddled with a group of switchboard operators upon
  the roof of the communication gazebo.
  </p>
  <p>
  	From his vantage point over
  Mossville, Theo could only see what was happening in the city, but he
  could all too well imagine the mayhem unfolding in Kook Bog. He ran
  to the doorway of Cess's office.</p>
  <p>
  	“You'll kill them!” he
  cried.</p>
  <p>
  	Cess turned on Theo.</p>
  <p>
  	“Boy, I've given you an
  incredible opportunity here,” he threatened. “Don't throw it away
  by making a nuisance of yourself!”</p>
  <p>
  	“No,” said Theo. “This
  isn't what I want.”</p>
  <p>
  	Cess lunged forward.</p>
  <p>
  	“Fine then!” he said. He
  straight-armed Theo hard in the chest, thrusting him back out the
  door onto the gondola platform. In the same motion he swung around
  and punched the gondola launch button in the wall.</p>
  <p>
  	The gondola shot off from the
  platform, catching Theo at an odd angle. Rather than wedging him into
  the seat, it knocked him crazily over the railing of the platform.
  Theo dangled from the platform, clutching the base of the railing as
  the gondola flew off.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Blast!” said Cess. He ran
  to the platform and stomped at Theo's hands.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo hung on by one hand then
  the other, avoiding Cess's kicks. He swung back and forth.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Below him to the side was the
  maintenance catwalk for the Suction-Flux Hydro-Debogilator. He swung
  with all his might, angling himself as well as he could towards the
  catwalk. He heaved towards the catwalk just as Cess's foot came down
  on the tips of his fingers.</p>
  <p>
  	“Ow!” he cried, letting
  go. He swung over to the catwalk and thumped down on his chest, his
  feet kicking out freely under him. He grunted in pain and hoisted
  himself onto the catwalk.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Cess rushed to the rail of the
  gondola platform to see Theo racing away along the catwalk towards
  the towering pump.</p>
  <p>
  	“Blasted little monkey!”
  seethed Cess. He ran back into his office. He emerged with a huge
  blunderbuss almost as long as he was tall. He packed in a round and
  leveled the gun.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo made it across the
  catwalk and climbed onto the maintenance ladder of the Suction-Flux
  Hydro-Debogilator itself. Cess squeezed off a round but the ball went
  wide of the mark. It struck the metal catwalk with a shower of sparks
  as Theo scrambled up the ladder.
  </p>
  <p>
  	In Kook Bog, the village was
  being torn apart. Buildings collapsed and the decks strained against
  the rushing flood of mud. Villagers climbed upon makeshift rafts and
  anything that would float. Whole houses came loose from their pilings
  and floated away, their residents clinging to chimneys and gutters
  for dear life. The communications gazebo shuddered and creaked.</p>
  <p>
  	Above, through a clearing in
  the clouds, Valerie saw the looming arc of Suction-Flux
  Hydro-Debogilator. She saw something else as well.</p>
  <p>
  	“Look!” she shouted.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The others looked. High above,
  enshrouded in mist and scarcely bigger than a speck, was a figure
  climbing the surface of the enormous structure.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“It's Theo!” said Valerie.

  </p>
  <p>
  	“What's he doing?” said
  Berke.</p>
  <p>
  	“Son!” said Rudy. “He's
  trying to save us!”</p>
  <p>
  ❉

  </p>
  <p >
  	The maintenance ladder was no
  more than a series of iron rungs welded onto the hull of the
  Suction-Flux Hydro-Debogilator. It extended all the way to the apex
  of the arc. Theo clung to the ladder and tried to resist the urge to
  look down. But the commotion behind him was impossible to ignore. He
  looked back over the catwalk and the house, where Cess stood raging
  on the balcony with his unwieldy firearm. Cess let off another
  poorly-aimed round and Theo flinched as the ball banged a dent in the
  iron below him.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Below, the fields and meadows
  around Mossville looked like a whirling green quilt. The far end of
  the black parabola extended into Kook Bog. From where Theo was at
  this height he could see the mud erupting from around the base of the
  enormous pump and coursing into the village. His head spun and he
  closed his eyes and gripped the rungs of the ladder.
  </p>
  <p >
  	He was near the peak of the
  arc when another blunderbuss ball struck the machine a few feet above
  him and a spray of water erupted from a ruptured hose. Buffeted by
  wind and moisture, Theo gripped the slick, wet metal of the rungs and
  pulled himself closer to the control box at the top of the pump. The
  rag around his wrist had come loose and fluttered like a tattered
  pink flag in the wind. The handcuff rattled against the hull of the
  machine. Slowly he made his way to the control box.
  </p>
  <p >
  	The control box was behind a
  tangle of narrow pipes and woefully inadequate-looking metal safety
  rails. To access the control box, Theo rested his foot against a pipe
  and leaned back against one of the rails, wedging himself in place.
  The narrow metal rail was no more than a half an inch thick and it
  strained under the full brunt of Theo's weight.
  </p>
  <p >
  	The control box was about five
  feet wide and three feet high. Theo struggled to remove the front
  panel which popped off suddenly and nearly caused him to lose his
  balance. The gunmetal rectangle fluttered into the abyss below.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Before him were the manual
  override controls for the Suction-Flux Hydro-Debogilator. He held his
  hand up to block some of the water spray so he could get a better
  look.
  </p>
  <p >
  	The panel was covered with
  hundreds of cryptically labeled switches, knobs, buttons and dials.
  Theo blinked. He had no idea where to begin. He remembered looking at
  the plans of the machine. The guide for the manual override had been
  missing.</p>
  <p >
  	He scanned the panel and
  racked his brain for some kind of clue. There must be some kind of
  logic to the controls. But he could not see it. There were far too
  many controls to guess at, and he could make no sense of any of them.</p>
  <p >
  	The water rushed over him and
  the screeching roar of the machine was deafening.
  </p>
  <p >
  <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
  ❉

  </p>
  <p >
  	Valerie, Rudy, and the rest
  watched Theo's tiny figure at the control panel on the apex of the
  machine.</p>
  <p >
  	“Nothing's happening,”
  said Valerie.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Oh,
  dear,” said Digniggleby. “It's as I feared.”</p>
  <p>
  	“What's the matter,
  Meriweather?” said Cynthia.</p>
  <p>
  	They all looked at
  Digniggleby. He shook his head.</p>
  <p>
  	“He can't operate the
  controls,” said Digniggleby. “I'm no expert, but I watched them
  build it. It's a very complicated machine. The standard operation is
  difficult enough, but the manual override is impossible. Even Mr.
  Cess doesn't know how that works.”</p>
  <p>
  	The group went quiet. If Theo
  wasn't able to operate the machine, it would all be for nothing. They
  would perish in the mud. And as for Theo, he would be trapped
  thousands of feet above the ground with no escape.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I know how it works.”</p>
  <p>
  	The voice came from behind
  them. They all turned to see its source.</p>
  <p>
  	The Kook Bog hermit stood
  before them on a large, knotty tree branch that jutted from the mud.
  His white hair was wild and his long beard waved in the wind. His
  eyes were focused and intense. Upon his left shoulder sat Buford the
  Toad.</p>
  <p>
  	Rudy gasped.</p>
  <p>
  	“Father!” he said.
  </p>
  <p>
  	For indeed, it was Pythagoras
  Promovendis himself who stood before them, the exiled inventor of the
  Suction-Flux Hydro-Debogilator and the unsung savior of Mossville.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Pythagoras looked at Rudy for
  several long moments.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“You always wanted to help
  me,” he said. “Well, you can help me now. I need a word with that
  boy.”</p>
  <p>
  	Rudy stared mutely at his
  long-lost father. He stared as if he were seeing an apparition.</p>
  <p>
  	“Now!” said Pythagoras.</p>
  <p>
  	Rudy snapped back to himself.
  He took out his palette and a pouch of substances. He gestured at
  Valerie to collect the twine and hooks that covered the gazebo.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I need a connection!” he
  said, hurriedly mixing up his pollens.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Bugs began to swirl and
  collect above the surface of the mud.
  </p>
  <p>
  ❉

  </p>
  <p >
  	Theo squeezed his eyes shut
  and tried to think. The pumping mechanisms of the Suction-Flux
  Hydro-Debogilator pounded furiously. If he did the wrong thing he
  would kill everyone in a single stroke. But if he did nothing, Kook
  Bog would be hopelessly submerged in no time. He had to do something,
  and fast.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Blindly, he reached towards
  the control panel. His hand hovered over the mess of switches and
  buttons.</p>
  <p >
  	“What am I doing?” he said
  out loud to himself.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Amid the roar another sound
  became audible. It was faint at first but became gradually louder.
  Theo recognized it immediately. It was the unmistakeable sound of
  bugs, many and near. Theo strained to look over his shoulder in the
  direction of the growing hum.</p>
  <p >
  	Behind him, a towering
  formation of bugs rose into the sky. Multifarious columns of insects
  swarmed in patterns, creating a dazzling, brightly-colored lattice.</p>
  <p >
  	But there was something else.
  Tight clusters of bugs were carrying things. Theo squinted through
  the mist to see. In a moment he recognized the objects. They were
  hooks from the Kook Bog telephone system. A long line of twine
  extended from one hook to the next in a broad, crazy zigzag from the
  ground to the sky. Theo watched in amazement as the final section of
  taut twine arced through the bright air toward him like the second
  hand of an enormous clock.</p>
  <p >
  	At the end of the twine was a
  tin can. It came to a stop within Theo's reach and he grabbed it.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Hello!” he spoke into the
  can, then hastily put it to his ear.</p>
  <p >
  	The voice he knew only as the
  hermit of Kook Bog came through the line.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Son, this is your
  grandfather,” said the voice. “Now listen close and do as I say.
  I'm not in the habit of wasting my breath.”</p>
  <p >
  	Theo blinked. For a moment he
  was too stunned to speak, but he caught himself quickly.</p>
  <p >
  	“Okay,” he said.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Below, in Kook Bog, the gazebo
  trembled violently, but Pythagoras stood steadily. Years of living in
  the outer reaches of Kook Bog had left him sure footed in even the
  muddiest of conditions. His eyes were steely and he spoke clearly
  into the tin can.</p>
  <p >
  	“There is a three by five
  grid of toggles to the left of three knobs. The current settings for
  the toggles are: on, off, off, on, on for the first row; off, off,
  off, on, on for the second row and; on, on, on, on, off for the third
  row. Is this what you see?”</p>
  <p >
  	Theo frantically searched the
  control panel for the toggles. There were so many toggles! A three by
  five grid to the right, no, to the left of three knobs... Yes, there
  they were. He quickly recalled the pattern Pythagoras had just read
  out. There was no time to ask him to repeat it.</p>
  <p >
  	“I think that's right,”
  said Theo.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“The second row needs to be
  set at: off, on, off, on, off,” said Pythagoras.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Theo flipped the switches.</p>
  <p >
  	“Second row,” he repeated,
  “off, on, off, off——”</p>
  <p >
  	“On!” corrected
  Pythagoras. “Off, on, off, on, off!”</p>
  <p >
  	Theo shook his head,
  flustered.</p>
  <p >
  	“Right, got it!” he said.
  “On.”</p>
  <p >
  	“Read it back to me!” said
  Pythagoras.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Theo read back the pattern. At
  once the shrieking of the Suction-Flux Hydro-Debogilator changed
  tone. Spray filled the air even more thickly than before. The bugs
  reacted to the spray. Their formation quivered and sections of the
  twine went momentarily slack.</p>
  <p >
  	“What did you say?” said
  Theo. “I can't hear you!”</p>
  <p >
  	Cess loaded another round into
  his blunderbuss. On the balcony behind Cess, Bea's bugs suddenly
  pulled away from her. Her body tensed and reeled, fighting to keep
  the bugs together. The cloud of bugs around her grew sparse and
  shapeless one moment, then drew into tight, knotty bunches the next.
  Her fists clenched as she struggled to keep herself together. She
  floated a few feet into the air on a shifting cloud of insects. She
  fought frantically as one limb after the next went slack and floated
  powerlessly.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Throughout the city, the army
  of automatons struggled the same way as their bugs abandoned them and
  rose to join the writhing swarms above. One by one the automatons
  dropped limply to the ground.
  </p>
  <p >
  	At the base of the
  Suction-Flux Hydro-Debogilator, a massive bubble of mud rose and
  burst. The mud flowed more heavily than ever.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Rudy struggled to stay upright
  as the splashing mud rushed by on all sides of the gazebo. He dipped
  a twig into chemical solutions and scrawled arcane, precise diagrams
  on the surface of a broad, wilted petal. He sucked his mustache
  nervously as he watched the bugs above respond.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Behind Theo, the bugs
  tightened their formation and pulled the line taut. Pythagoras's
  voice came through the can.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Find the aperture knob.
  It's below the pressure meter on the left side of the panel. It's
  black with a silver base. Red numbers around it.”</p>
  <p >
  	“There are... there are two
  like that,” said Theo.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“No there aren't!” said
  Pythagoras. “Silver base!”</p>
  <p >
  	Sure enough, only one had a
  silver base. The other was all black.</p>
  <p >
  	“Set that to the square root
  of the value on the pressure meter,” said Pythagoras.</p>
  <p >
  	“Huh?” Theo blurted.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“What does the pressure
  meter say?” said Pythagoras.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“The... the one with the
  needle?”</p>
  <p >
  	“Yes! The red needle!”</p>
  <p >
  	There was a meter with a red
  needle all right, but it was vibrating so rapidly it was impossible
  to get a reading for it.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“It's going back and forth a
  lot,” said Theo.</p>
  <p >
  	“Between what?”</p>
  <p >
  	“About 105 and 111,” said
  Theo.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Call it 108,” said
  Pythagoras. “Set the aperture at 10.4!”</p>
  <p >
  	“Okay!” said Theo.</p>
  <p >
  	“Now all that's left is to
  enter the values for the shunt and to trigger the alternate output,”
  said Pythagoras. “First of all, do you see the output nozzle at the
  top of the arch? Big brass flange at the base?”</p>
  <p >
  	Theo looked up above his head
  to see the massive grated nozzle at the peak of the machine. It
  looked like an enormous sprinkler head.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Yeah, I see it,” said
  Theo. “What do I need to do with it?”</p>
  <p >
  	“You need to stay clear of
  it!” said Pythagoras. “Now find the numerical key pad and enter
  these values. And listen good, because there's not enough time for me
  to say this twice!”</p>
  <p >
  	Pythagoras began reciting
  numbers. Theo frantically punched the round, mechanical number keys
  with one hand, steadying himself against the rushing spray with the
  other. He held the tin can in the crook of his neck.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“...6, 4, 0, 0, 1, 2, 6,”
  finished Pythagoras. “Did you get that all?”
  </p>
  <p >
  	“I think so,” said Theo.</p>
  <p >
  	“Now just switch the release
  to auxiliary and stay clear,” said Pythagoras.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo
  saw the knob labeled <em>RELEASE</em>.
  There were two labels: <em>Main</em>
  and <em>Auxiliary</em>.
  The arrow was pointing to <em>Main</em>.

  </p>
  <p >
  	“Okay,” said Theo. He
  reached towards the knob.
  </p>
  <p >
  	On the balcony below, Cess
  steadied his blunderbuss for another shot. He squeezed the trigger
  and a blast rang out. The round struck the hull just inches away from
  Theo's head with a deafening clang. The impact jolted the machine and
  Theo jerked reflexively. The struts that supported the safety rail
  beneath him gave way and he tumbled backwards, flailing his arms. The
  handcuff on his wrist caught on one of the struts and he dangled
  helplessly.</p>
  <p >
  	“Got you, you little
  bugger!” sneered Cess.
  </p>
  <p >
  	The others saw Theo fall as
  well.</p>
  <p >
  	“Theo!” cried Valerie.</p>
  <p >
  	Pythagoras spoke under his
  breath. “Auxiliary release, boy!”</p>
  <p >
  	Theo summoned all his strength
  to pull himself up, but the harder he struggled the more the strut
  bent downward.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Valerie turned to Rudy. “The
  bugs!” she cried.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Rudy was already drawing
  frantically on the petal. He sucked madly on his mustache.
  </p>
  <p >
  	A cloud of gnats thickened
  around Theo, creating a living, flying cushion in the air. The cloud
  rose and Theo rose with it. He reached out as far as he could. His
  fingers touched the release knob. He turned it.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Water erupted from the massive
  nozzle in a huge, explosive torrent. The gnats dispersed in a moment,
  dropping Theo back to where he had been dangling at the end of the
  strut. The rushing water whipped him to and fro.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Water poured over Cess as he
  stood on his balcony, knocking him off of his feet. The house
  shuddered and shook. Bea's bugs abandoned her and her body toppled
  over the rail of the balcony. A cloud of bugs followed her down.
  </p>
  <p >
  	In Kook Bog, water poured from
  the sky. Everyone covered themselves in the deluge. Digniggleby
  turned to Pythagoras desperately.</p>
  <p >
  	“What's happening?” he
  said.</p>
  <p >
  	Pythagoras watched the
  torrents emerging from the Suction-Flux Hydro-Debogilator and raised
  his index finger.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“One moment...” he said.
  </p>
  <p >
  	A moment passed.</p>
  <p >
  	“Now,” he said.
  </p>
  <p >
  	With a thunderous roar, a huge
  blast of mist exploded from the nozzle of the Suction-Flux
  Hydro-Debogilator. At once the water no longer fell downward but
  rather formed an enormous floating disk of moisture that extended
  upward and outward, spreading well beyond both Mossville and Kook
  Bog. The sun shone through the mist in brilliant, shifting rainbows
  that shimmered over the land as far as the eye could see.</p>
  <p >
  	In Kook Bog the mud slowed and
  began to subside. The clouds broke up over the bog and the sun shone
  brightly on the trees.
  </p>
  <p >
  	The ground in Mossville
  softened and bubbled. Clouds of moisture burst from the ground in
  puffs like steam from thick, simmering soup. The ground beneath the
  patent office shifted nauseatingly and gave way. The scaffolding
  holding up Cess's house splayed outward and folded in upon itself in
  a scream of twisting, scraping steel. Cables snapped and whipped the
  air and the elevator crumpled like cardboard. The house groaned and
  split clean down the middle, an explosion of glass and dust and
  shingles bursting from the rupture. The whole crumbling house toppled
  slowly and fell from its lofty perch in a spectacular, earth-shaking
  collapse. A monstrous cloud of dust and debris rose as the building
  plunged into the thickening mud, pulverized by its own weight.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Far above Theo still hung by
  his wrist, exhausted, from the end of the straining strut.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Valerie pointed at him and
  screamed.</p>
  <p >
  	“Help him!”</p>
  <p >
  	Rudy mixed pollens and drew
  frantically, but the bugs would not be controlled.</p>
  <p >
  	“I'm trying! It's all the
  water!” he said.
  </p>
  <p >
  	A sparse cloud of insects
  circled Theo aimlessly. They whirled and glided and drifted away. A
  purple and black-winged butterfly fluttered idly in front of Theo's
  nose.</p>
  <p >
  	The strut bent downward, the
  handcuff slipped free, and Theo fell.
  </p>
