  <p>
  	Cess
  sat on the sofa in the
  living room of the mayoral mansion. Across the coffee table Cynthia
  and Mayor Digniggleby sat stiffly together on a loveseat. On the
  table a tray of fancy sandwiches and three glasses of cognac were
  laid out. Beside the tray stood Cess's reel-to-reel tape recorder.
  Digniggleby glanced at it uneasily.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“It is a pleasure as
  always,” said Cess.</p>
  <p>
  	“Isn't it though!” said
  Digniggleby.</p>
  <p>
  	“Such a charming pleasure!”
  said Cynthia.</p>
  <p>
  	Digniggleby and Cynthia each
  sipped their cognac.</p>
  <p>
  	“Was there anything, in
  particular, you wanted to discuss on this pleasant afternoon, Mayor?”
  said Cess.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Digniggleby put down his
  cognac.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Well, as a matter of
  fact..” began Digniggleby, trailing off. Cynthia dug her elbow into
  his ribcage. He cleared his throat. “I wanted to, ahem, offer you a
  bit of a promotion, actually.”</p>
  <p>
  	Cess barely concealed his
  sneer.</p>
  <p>
  	“A promotion,” he said.</p>
  <p>
  	“Well,” said Digniggleby.
  “We——that is, <em>I</em>——were,
  um, thinking that... a man of your talents can't be satisfied with,
  ahem, clerical work. That is, administrative work. I thought maybe
  you'd like to leave the patent office to someone else.”</p>
  <p>
  	“The patent office to
  someone else?” repeated Cess. “And what would I do?”</p>
  <p>
  	“Yes, well,” said
  Digniggleby. “You would assume another, very important——really
  incredibly important——role.”</p>
  <p>
  	Cess tilted his head
  inquisitively.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“You would be...” said
  Digniggleby. “That is to say, your very esteemed title would
  become, ahem, Official Archduke of Mossville.”</p>
  <p>
  	“Official <em>what</em>?”</p>
  <p>
  	“Archduke.”</p>
  <p>
  	Cess raised an eyebrow.</p>
  <p>
  	“I didn't know this city had
  an archduke,” he said. “Official or otherwise.”</p>
  <p>
  	“Oh, uh, yes, I see,” said
  Digniggleby. “Well, I kind of made it up. To befit, that is, your
  esteemed, uh, you. That is, it's new. But it's very important.”</p>
  <p>
  	“And what does the Official
  Archduke do?” asked Cess. “Officially.”</p>
  <p>
  	Digniggleby squirmed. He
  turned to Cynthia for support, but she stared straight ahead at Cess,
  a wide, artificial smile pasted across her face. Digniggleby smiled
  as well.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Cess let the awkward silence
  linger. He took a sip of his cognac.</p>
  <p>
  	“I must say I am most
  flattered,” he said at last. “And to think the very position of
  Official Archduke was concocted entirely for my sake. Such an unheard
  of honor.”</p>
  <p>
  	Digniggleby grinned
  sheepishly.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“But,” Cess continued, “I
  feel I simply could not shirk my duties as Chief Patent
  Administrator. It's not the kind of work that can be left to just
  anyone, after all.”</p>
  <p>
  	“Ehrrr,” said Digniggleby.

  </p>
  <p>
  	Cess observed Cynthia's
  jewelry.</p>
  <p>
  	“May I say, Mrs.
  Digniggleby, that is an extraordinary brooch.”
  </p>
  <p>
  	Cynthia's face puckered
  indecipherably.</p>
  <p>
  	Before she could respond, the
  front door of the mansion slammed open with a crash and Valerie burst
  into the room sobbing. She had a strange bundle in her arms and a
  cloud of insects trailed her.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Help! Daddy! Somebody
  help!” she cried.</p>
  <p>
  	Everyone in the room leaped to
  their feet. The butler ran in from the hall. The cloud of bugs
  dispersed throughout the room as Valerie put Bea down on the sofa.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Goodness!” exclaimed
  Cynthia. “What on earth have you brought in?”
  </p>
  <p>
  	“She's going to die!”
  sobbed Valerie.</p>
  <p>
  	In an instant, Mr. Cess stood
  up and took charge.</p>
  <p>
  	“Remain calm!” he
  commanded. “Everything is under control!”</p>
  <p>
  	Cess turned to the butler.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“You!” he said. “Bring a
  bucket of boiling water!”</p>
  <p>
  	“Yes sir!” said the
  butler, and raced to the kitchen.</p>
  <p>
  	Cess turned to Valerie. “You!
  Go and fetch me ten white handkerchiefs, folded diagonally in
  eighths!”</p>
  <p>
  	Valerie nodded through her
  tears and ran up the stairs toward the bedrooms.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Cess turned to Cynthia. “You!
  Bring me five empty toilet paper tubes, glued together end to end.
  And firmly!” he directed.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Cynthia, puzzled, ran upstairs
  to do as she was told.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Cess turned to Mayor
  Digniggleby. “You! Bring me a balloon poodle! A red one”</p>
  <p>
  	“A... a balloon poodle?”
  said Digniggleby.</p>
  <p>
  	“You heard me!” said Cess.
  “And hurry!”</p>
  <p>
  	“O-okay,” said
  Digniggleby, scurrying out the door.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Cess turned to where Bea lay
  twitching sluggishly on the sofa. He smiled mirthlessly and reached
  down to pick her up.
  </p>
  <p>
  ❉	</p>
  <p>
  	Theo
  sat on the floor of Cess's office surrounded by decades worth of
  plans. Crisp white blueprints and yellowing, stained parchments
  papered the floor and covered the desk.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Finding a particular device
  among these plans was like searching for a needle in a haystack. He
  had no idea how they were organized, though it was clear there was a
  system. Each plan was labeled with a six digit number and had a
  colored tag affixed, and the rows and columns of the rack were marked
  with a sequence of four alphanumeric symbols. But none of this held
  any meaning for Theo. He searched the only way he could, by pulling
  out as many plans as he could and going through them one by one.
  </p>
  <p>
  	It was all too easy to become
  distracted. There were plans for vehicles, toys, household
  appliances, industrial machines, even weapons. Some were childishly
  simple and others were mind-bendingly complex. There were electrical
  circuits, clockwork movements, and hydraulic systems, all drawn and
  labeled in painstaking detail. But one set of plans had caught his
  eye the moment he unrolled it. It was without a doubt the most
  recognizable form in all of Mossville: the massive, mighty arch of
  the Suction-Flux Hydro-Debogilator.</p>
  <p>
  	At first, it was just
  curiosity that made Theo look more closely at the plans. That, and
  the thrill of seeing such a familiar landmark amid the mess of arcane
  diagrams strewn over the floor. But the closer he looked at the
  workings of the Suction-Flux Hydro-Debogilator the more engrossed he
  became by its strange but ingenious logic. It was hard to square what
  he saw in these plans with his buffoonish perception of Mayor
  Digniggleby. The more Theo studied the blueprints the more convinced
  he became that he had seriously misjudged the mayor. It was truly a
  remarkable invention. Remarkable enough that Theo soon lost track the
  passage of time.</p>
  <p>
  	In the lower left corner of
  the diagram a control panel was drawn, labeled <em>Main
  Control</em>. Another
  panel drawn at the apex of the arch was labeled <em>Manual
  System Override: See Further Instructions for Operation</em>.
  Theo searched the front and back of the blueprint, but could not find
  anything further related to the manual override.</p>
  <p>
  	He looked up. Across the room,
  a large metal box was affixed to the wall. An array of metal pipes
  and tubes extended from the box and down through the floor of the
  room. Across the front of the box, in red stenciled letters, was
  written <em>SFHD MAIN</em>.

  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo walked over and opened
  the front panel of the control box. Inside the box was a bank of
  buttons and switches, in the middle of which was a large Bakelite
  dial knob. A circular panel around the knob was color coded green,
  yellow and red, presumably indicating safety limits. The knob's
  pointer was just inside the green area.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Suddenly, a slam echoed up the
  elevator shaft and the engine began to hum. The sound of the elevator
  rumbling into motion filled the room.
  </p>
  <p>
  	In a panic, Theo scrambled to
  hide the mess he had made. He thrust plans and diagrams haphazardly
  into drawers, but it was beyond hopeless. He switched off the light
  and dashed out the door he had entered. No sooner had he gotten out
  the door than the elevator opened into the room. Cess stepped out and
  switched the light back on.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo was just about to dive
  onto the ladder below and take his chances climbing down when a sound
  from inside the room caught his attention. It was a distinctive
  combination of the buzzing of insects and the clicking of machinery.
  Theo turned slowly and pushed the door open a crack.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo saw Cess toss something
  onto the desk. It was impossible to make out the shape of the object,
  but the sliver of purple was unmistakeable. It was Bea's dress. And
  the sound Theo heard was unmistakeable too.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Suddenly, the door flew wide
  open and for a brief moment Theo had a full view of Bea, flung
  gracelessly across the desk, twitching and writhing horribly.</p>
  <p>
  	Theo froze.</p>
  <p>
  	“Bea!” he cried.</p>
  <p>
  	Mr. Cess stepped into the
  doorway and Theo's view of Bea was concealed.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Now <em>this</em>
  is convenient,” said Cess.</p>
  <p >
  	Cess reached towards the red
  button by the door and punched it forcefully. A whooshing sound came
  from over Theo's head and before he knew what was happening a large
  wooden bucket on the end of a steel pole swung down under his rear
  end and scooped him right up off the platform and into the air.
  </p>
  <p>
  ❉	</p>
  <p >
  	In the mayoral mansion,
  Valerie cried uncontrollably. Scattered on the floor of the living
  room were a bucket of water, a bunch of folded handkerchiefs, and an
  awkwardly glued pole of toilet paper rolls. Cynthia petted her
  daughter's hair and tried to console her.</p>
  <p >
  	“We'll get you another doll,
  sweetheart! We can find a much prettier one than that old thing!”
  she said.</p>
  <p >
  	“Bea's not a doll!”
  protested Valerie. “She's alive”.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Valerie, honey, it was
  covered with bugs! You don't want a horrible toy like that,” said
  Cynthia.</p>
  <p >
  	Valerie stopped crying
  suddenly and stood up. She stamped her foot angrily.</p>
  <p >
  	“She's not a toy!” she
  said. “I need to get her back. He'll kill her!”</p>
  <p >
  	“Valerie, now, calm down,”
  said Cynthia. “Nobody's going to kill anybody. When your father
  comes home he'll take care of everything.”</p>
  <p >
  	At that, Digniggleby burst
  through the front door, beet-red and covered with glistening sweat.
  He stood in the middle of the living room, doubled over with one hand
  on his knee, heaving and panting. With the other hand he held up a
  poodle dog made from one long twisted-up red balloon. Between gasps
  he could barely get the words out.</p>
  <p >
  	“Got it!” he said.
