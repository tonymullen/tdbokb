  <p>
  	Theo lay panting, sprawled on
  the ground in the shelter in the woods. The loose end of the handcuff
  lay beside his left hand. He was more lonely and confused than ever.
  What was going on? Where was his father? How did those men get the
  plans to the engine?</p>
  <p>
  	He looked over at his
  creation. The insects buzzed contentedly.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“At least you're safe,” he
  said.
  </p>
  <p>
  	A rustling sound came from
  outside the shelter. Startled, Theo looked up to see a clump of
  branches thrust aside. The sun spilled into his eyes and he squinted
  up at the back-lit figure of Valerie standing over him.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Who are you talking to?”
  demanded Valerie.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Unconsciously, Theo glanced
  down at where his creation sat concealed in the shadow of the
  shelter. Valerie's eyes followed his.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Bea!” she exclaimed. She
  pulled another bundle of branches out of her way and charged into the
  shelter.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo jumped to his feet.</p>
  <p>
  	“No!” he shouted. He
  reached out to stop her.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Valerie grabbed Theo's wrist
  and in a single deft movement flipped him over her shoulder. Theo
  landed flat on his back with a loud thump. He moved his mouth like a
  fish out of water as he struggled to get his breath.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“You picked the wrong girl
  to mess with,” said Valerie. “I've been doing ballet since I was
  two.”</p>
  <p>
  	Theo managed to inhale.</p>
  <p>
  	“That's... not... ballet!”
  he gasped.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“My ballet teacher knows
  karate,” she said. “Don't tell my mom. Now give me back my doll!”</p>
  <p>
  	She reached out to grab the
  creation. Suddenly, she stopped.</p>
  <p>
  	The doll was moving. What's
  more, it was covered with bugs. Covered wasn't even the word. It was
  engulfed in bugs, filled with bugs——it almost seemed to be <em>made</em>
  <em>of</em>
  bugs. It certainly didn't look much like the Baby Doll Bea her mother
  had given her.</p>
  <p >
  	“What is... this?” she
  asked, crinkling her nose.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“It's none of your
  business,” said Theo, who had managed to raise himself to all fours
  and was beginning to breathe normally again.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“What have you done with my
  doll?” demanded Theo.</p>
  <p >
  	Theo shook his head.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“It's not your doll
  anymore,” he said.
  </p>
  <p >
  	The two of them watched the
  creature move. Valerie's jaw dropped slowly.</p>
  <p >
  	Narrow streams of green aphids
  wound up and down the copper and steel skeleton as though circulating
  through invisible veins and arteries, from the torso to the
  fingertips and toes. Clouds of gnats clustered around the joints,
  tapping out skittering patterns on tiny switches that lined the
  limbs. Moths, cicadas, and crickets tugged tiny fibers attached to
  tiny networks of pulleys to create the effect of flexing muscles.
  </p>
  <p >
  	The porcelain head of Baby
  Doll Bea stared back at the two children. The top of the head was
  open to expose the delicate clockwork of the head, from which
  hundreds of butterflies, moths, and bees emerged on threadlike
  tethers that looked like a thick head of wildly writhing hair. The
  flashes of fireflies emanated from the doll's eye holes, creating an
  uncanny sense of intelligence.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“What is it?”</p>
  <p >
  	“It's an automaton,” said
  Theo. “I made it.”</p>
  <p >
  	“It's weird!” said
  Valerie.</p>
  <p >
  	“Shut up! It's not weird,”
  said Theo.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Anyway, it's still mine,”
  said Valerie. “You still have to give it back.”</p>
  <p >
  	She paused for a moment,
  looking at the creature.</p>
  <p >
  	“Her name's Bea,” she
  said.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“No way,” said Theo. “You
  stay away from it. And it's not a 'her' anyway.”</p>
  <p >
  	“What are you going to do to
  stop me?” challenged Valerie. “Would you hit a girl?”</p>
  <p >
  	Theo wasn't sure he'd hit a
  girl, and he was even less sure he wanted to try it with this one.</p>
  <p >
  	“Don't touch it,” he said
  as forcefully as he could.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“You're going to get in so
  much trouble,” said Valerie, narrowing her eyes. “Wait till I
  tell.”</p>
  <p >
  	“No!” cried Theo. “You
  can't tell! They'd take it away and throw me in jail!”</p>
  <p >
  	“You stole my doll!”
  Valerie charged. “You belong in jail! I hope they throw away the
  key!”</p>
  <p >
  	Theo went pale.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“They'll destroy it!” he
  said.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Valerie stared at the
  creature, mesmerized by its strange, infantile movements.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Can it... see us?” she
  said.</p>
  <p >
  	“In a way,” said Theo.
  “The bugs can see.”</p>
  <p >
  	“It's just a bunch of bugs?”
  said Valerie.</p>
  <p >
  	“Not exactly,” said Theo.
  “The bugs are... interacting. I set up patterns for them to follow
  using special chemicals. When they follow their patterns they
  influence each other and...”</p>
  <p >
  	Theo gestured at the creature.</p>
  <p >
  	“Behavior arises,” he
  said. “You could think of it as a brain made of bugs.”</p>
  <p >
  	“That's disgusting,” said
  Valerie.</p>
  <p >
  	She cocked her head.</p>
  <p >
  	“Is it smart?” she asked.</p>
  <p >
  	“I don't really know yet,”
  said Theo. “I think it's learning.”</p>
  <p >
  	Theo looked at Valerie with
  pleading eyes.</p>
  <p >
  	“Listen,” he said. “If
  you tell on me they'll take it away. They don't know how to take care
  of it. It would die for sure.”</p>
  <p >
  	“Does it eat?” asked
  Valerie.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Kind of,” said Theo.
  “It's complicated though. I need to give it the right pollens. If
  the mix isn't right, or it gets exposed to the wrong scents, it will
  have problems.”</p>
  <p >
  	Valerie considered.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Fine,”
  she said. “I'll keep your secret. On one condition. It's <em>half</em>
  <em>mine</em>.
  And it's a <em>she</em>.
  And her name is <em>Bea</em>.”</p>
  <p >
  	“That's three conditions!”
  cried Theo.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“I meant three,” said
  Valerie. “Deal or not?”</p>
  <p >
  	Theo was gutted. He gave
  Valerie's offer a moment of anguished thought, but could see no
  alternative.</p>
  <p>
  	“Okay,”
  he said. “But no telling anybody, <em>no</em>
  <em>matter</em>
  <em>what</em>.”</p>
  <p >
  	Valerie approached Bea.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Actually, you're not so
  weird looking once a person gets used to you, are you?” she said.
  She looked at Bea's mechanical body. “But you do need clothes.”
  </p>
  <p >
  	Theo watched in helpless
  horror. What had he gotten himself into now?</p>
  <p >
  	Valerie turned to Theo and
  gestured to the handcuffs dangling from his wrist.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“You should get rid of
  those,” she said. “It sets a bad example.”
  </p>

<p>
  	In the aftermath of the swarm,
  the handful of people who remained in the town square shooed off the
  last few clumps of bugs. Everyone was covered with bites and welts.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Get that boy,” said Cess.</p>
  <p >
  	“Yes sir,” said Dooley.</p>
  <p >
  	“I've got a plan to get him,
  sir,” said Ballhatchet.</p>
  <p >
  	“Shut up, Ballhatchet,”
  said Dooley.</p>
  <p >
  	Ballhatchet cast a hurt glance
  at Dooley.</p>
  <p >
  	“Why? It's a good idea,”
  he said. “Believe me!”</p>
  <p >
  	“I don't care how you do
  it,” growled Cess. “Just——”</p>
  <p >
  	A beetle poked its head out
  from Cess's nostril.</p>
  <p >
  	“Uh, boss——” began
  Ballhatchet.</p>
  <p >
  	Cess sneezed and the beetle
  popped out. Cess winced in fury as it flew away.
