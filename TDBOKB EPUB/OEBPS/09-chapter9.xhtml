  <p>
  	The next day Cess was
  unusually attentive as he conducted his interviews. In addition to
  the standard patent office questions he asked every day, he threw in
  a few of his own. He studied the applicants' facial expressions and
  carefully noted their responses to his comments and questions. He
  wasn't entirely sure what he was looking for, but he felt confident
  he would know it when he saw it.
  </p>
  <p>
  	A pudgy, blank-faced young man
  sat across from him. He looked like a lump of bread dough with red
  cheeks.</p>
  <p>
  	“Name?” said Cess.</p>
  <p>
  	“Digniggleby,” said the
  man. “Meriweather.”</p>
  <p>
  	“Application form and
  plans,” said Cess.</p>
  <p>
  	Digniggleby passed a single
  sheet of paper across the table.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I wasn't too sure about how
  to fill out the form,” he said. “But here are the plans.”</p>
  <p>
  	Cess looked at the plans.
  There was nothing on the paper but a drawing of an oval.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“This?” said Cess.	</p>
  <p>
  	Digniggleby nodded
  enthusiastically.</p>
  <p>
  	“What is it?” said Cess.</p>
  <p>
  	“It's a paperweight!” said
  Digniggleby.</p>
  <p>
  	“A paperweight,” said
  Cess.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Digniggleby nodded again.</p>
  <p>
  	“You do realize an invention
  has to be new in some way to be eligible for a patent,” said Cess.</p>
  <p>
  	“Oh, but it is!” said
  Digniggleby. “See, it's oblong! And it's made of soap!”</p>
  <p>
  	“Oblong?” said Cess.</p>
  <p>
  	“To fit in your hand better!
  It's much easier to pick up than a round paperweight!” said
  Digniggleby. “At least, in theory.”
  </p>
  <p>
  	Sensing that Cess was not
  impressed, Digniggleby continued with even greater urgency.</p>
  <p>
  	“A-and when your hands get
  dirty from handling all the inky paper, it doubles as soap!” he
  said.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Cess looked at Digniggleby for
  a long moment without speaking.</p>
  <p>
  	“I see,” he said at last.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Digniggleby smiled fatly.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“May I ask you a question?”
  said Cess.</p>
  <p>
  	“Sure,” said Digniggleby.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“How would you like to own
  the patent for something important?” said Cess. “For something
  that will make you, overnight, the most beloved man in this town?”</p>
  <p>
  	“The paperweight?” said
  Digniggleby.</p>
  <p>
  	“No,” said Cess.</p>
  <p>
  	“Well,” said Digniggleby,
  “I don't know... I haven't really invented anything else.”</p>
  <p>
  	“That's not what I'm
  asking,” said Cess. “I'm asking if you would like to own the
  patent.”</p>
  <p>
  	Digniggleby looked puzzled.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“You see,” explained Cess,
  “it seems we have some unclaimed patents lying around, and I have
  been asked to find worthy owners for them. I think you fit the bill.”</p>
  <p>
  	“Really, I do?” said
  Digniggleby.</p>
  <p>
  	Cess smiled.</p>
  <p>
  	“Yes,” he said. “You
  really do.”</p>
  <p>
  	And so began the salvation of
  Mossville.
  </p>
  <p>
  	After Cess fast-tracked the
  patent application, things moved very quickly. The town's denial of
  the catastrophe vanished when they realized a solution had been
  found, and the citizens quickly rallied to build the Suction-Flux
  Hydro-Debogilator. It was far and away the most ambitious
  construction project that had ever broken ground anywhere in the
  vicinity of Greater Mossville County. Cess and Digniggleby stayed on
  site throughout the process. They made an odd pair in their hard hats
  and protective boots. Cess barked orders to construction workers and
  Digniggleby just smiled blankly. The massive arch of pipes and pumps
  extended high into the sky, its far end disappearing into the ravine
  beyond the distant ridge.
  </p>
  <p>
  	When the construction was
  finished, Digniggleby, with an embarrassed grin and an ill-fitting
  suit, cut the ribbon. Cess stood behind him to one side. The huge
  machine groaned and rumbled to life. Hoses and tubes that rose along
  its shaft began to pulsate and the throbbing hum of its pumps made
  the ground beneath the town square tremble.</p>
  <p>
  	Throughout Mossville, the mud
  began to recede and the ground began to dry and harden. Soon it was
  clear to everyone that the catastrophe had been averted.
  Digniggleby's Suction-Flux Hydro-Debogilator had saved the town.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Hailed as a hero,
  Digniggleby's personal advancement was swift. After a week of
  celebration, he was awarded the keys to the Mayor's mansion for life.
  No-one had ever done so much for Mossville, felt the citizens. If it
  had not been for Meriweather Digniggleby and his extraordinary
  invention, the entire city would have perished. It was the least they
  could do in gratitude.</p>
  <p>
  	With a friend in such a high
  place, Mr. Cess's fortunes soon changed for the better as well. By
  Mayoral Decree, Cess was promoted to Chief Patent Administrator.
  Municipal funding was allocated to ensure he had the resources
  necessary to carry out his duties effectively. After all, it was
  thanks to his rapid processing of Digniggleby's patent that the town
  had been saved.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The necessary resources turned
  out to include a luxurious elevated personal residence built to Mr
  Cess's exact specifications directly over the patent office,
  accessible via private elevator. Among his specifications were plans
  for a cable gondola that extended from a platform on his home into
  the distant ravine beyond the ridge.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Far away, in that deep, misty
  ravine beyond the ridge, the other end of the Suction-Flux
  Hydro-Debogilator was embedded in the ground. Wet mud burbled around
  it.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Twenty-four weeks and one day
  after the submission of his patent application, Pythagoras
  Promovendis sat angrily in the waiting area of the patent office.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“The Chief Patent
  Administrator will see you now,” said the receptionist, gesturing
  towards the elevator. “Right this way.”</p>
  <p>
  	As Pythagoras passed her desk
  she remarked, “You're very fortunate. Mr. Cess rarely meets with
  claimants.”</p>

<p>
  	The
  intervening years had not been especially kind to Felix
  the clerk. His
  organizational skills were as sharp as ever, but a hollowness had
  crept into his eyes. His face had become gray and thin along with his
  perfectly-combed hair. He stood now before Mr. Cess's desk.</p>
  <p>
  	 “You know how I feel about
  numbers, Felix,” said Cess. “It's why you're down there and I'm
  up here.”</p>
  <p>
  	Felix nodded.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Yes, of course,” he said.
  “But I really feel these inconsistencies require your attention.”</p>
  <p>
  	Cess rolled his eyes.</p>
  <p>
  	“Fine. What do you want to
  tell me?” he said.</p>
  <p>
  	“It's the records from human
  services, sir,” said Felix.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Yes,” said Cess.</p>
  <p>
  	“Well, sir, it's considered
  standard for personnel to receive a pay raise every two years to
  account for costs of living,” said Felix.</p>
  <p>
  	“And?” said Cess.</p>
  <p>
  	“Well, sir, it has been
  quite some time since the clerical department has received a raise,”
  said Felix. “To be precise, we haven't received a raise since...”</p>
  <p>
  	Felix trailed off.</p>
  <p>
  	“Since?” prompted Cess.</p>
  <p>
  	“Well, sir, since you took
  over as Chief Patent Administrator twenty years ago,” said Felix.</p>
  <p>
  	“I see,” said Cess.</p>
  <p>
  	“I thought you should be
  aware of that,” said Felix.</p>
  <p>
  	Cess sat quietly for a long
  moment, fingertips pressed together. His eyes narrowed.</p>
  <p>
  	“The next time you feel the
  urge to bring this kind of clerk trivia to my attention,” he said,
  “I hope you have a more compelling reason than your own personal
  greed. You ground-floor paper pushers are paid every penny of what
  you're worth. The day you become worth more is the day you'll get a
  raise. Which, frankly, is not a day I see coming any time soon.”</p>
  <p>
  	Felix opened his mouth to
  protest, but stopped, not knowing quite what to say.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Speaking of pay, don't you
  have some kind of work you ought to be doing to earn yours?” said
  Cess.

<p>
  	In
  the city center of Mossville, Ballhatchet and Dooley were posting
  fliers. Ballhatchet nailed one to a wooden post. It read
  </p>

  <p>
  PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF AN
  EXTRAORDINARY NEW INVENTION</p>
  <p>
  TOMORROW 2:00 <em>SHARP</em>

  </p>
  <p>
  MOSSVILLE TOWN SQUARE	</p>

  <p>
  	“I'm
  excited about this,” said Ballhatchet.</p>
  <p>
  	“You don't even know what
  the invention is,” said Dooley.</p>
  <p>
  	“I bet it's baby wigs!”
  said Ballhatchet.</p>
  <p>
  	“Baby wigs?” said Dooley.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Every time I see a baby, I
  think, why doesn't he have hair? It doesn't make sense for babies to
  be bald like that,” said Ballhatchet.</p>
  <p>
  	Dooley sneered.</p>
  <p>
  	“I doubt Mr. Cess is
  planning to announce baby wigs, Ballhatchet,” he said.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“No need to be so negative,”
  said Ballhatchet.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Dooley shook his head and
  nailed a flier to a wooden cobbler shop sign.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Hey!” cried the
  proprietor from inside the shop.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Municipal authorities,”
  said Dooley. “Back off.”</p>
