	<p>
	The moth's
powdery wings
sparkled golden and gray in the dim light of the old
bulb overhead.
Theo Promovendis held its
body gingerly between the tips of his fingers. Getting
them into the harnesses
was
the most difficult part. This
one was the last. Theo sucked his lip in concentration as he placed
the moth's body into the delicate wire
structure, carefully
inserting each leg into its place. A fine, dark thread ran
from the harness. Theo
snapped the tiny latch across the moth's midsection
and released the moth to join the mass of others fluttering above his
desk. Each
one was tethered
to the complex
mechanical apparatus laid out across the desktop.</p>
<p>
	Although it was daytime, the
light from the bulb was the only illumination in Theo's bedroom aside
from a narrow crack at the edge of his curtains. His father often
complained that he should spend more time outside in the sunlight,
but that
couldn't be helped. After
all, it was only
because of his father's annoying rules
that Theo was forced
to work in such secrecy in
the first place.
</p>
<p>
	The room was strewn with the
makings of countless
projects. Parts and pulleys, springs and sprockets, bulbs, tubes and
bearings covered the floor
and sat in piles in the
corners of the room.
Theo was
always finding discarded
little
mechanical treasures around
town, particularly in the mother lode of
the  Mossville Municipal
Dump. At least, the things
he found had
<em>mostly</em>
been discarded.
On the occasions when Theo borrowed items that were
(strictly speaking)
still in use, it
was always with the intention
to
return them as soon as he was finished with them. But of course, the
work of such a
restless young inventor was never really finished.</p>
<p>
	There were other things in the
room more typical of a boy of eleven. There
were models of
airplanes, ships and
trains in various states of completion.
Vehicles made of
balsa wood, cloth, paper and tin were scattered on the shelves of the
book case and
displayed atop the wardrobe and the large antique cabinet.
</p>
<p>
	On the bookshelf, among comic
books and hobby
magazines, stood several
imposing tomes. Among the books were
<em>The Boy's Anthology
of Tales of High Adventure</em>,
<em>Braustache &amp;
Bakerfield's Illustrated Encyclopedia of Mechanical Movements and
Assemblies</em>,
<em>The
Comprehensive Guide to the Design and Construction of Lifelike
Clockwork Automata</em>,
and
<em>Waldo Malone's
How To Build Your Own Analytical Engine with Odds And Ends From
Around the House</em>.
In the corner beside the bookshelf lay more
books concealed
under
blankets, newspaper
comics
pages,
and hand-drawn blueprints. The worn bindings of <em>The Young
Outdoorsman's
Field Guide to The Noble
Gnat and His
Habitats</em>,
<em>Physics
for the Amateur Horticulturist</em>
and
<em>Bullock and
Brewster's Compendium of Arthropod Semiochemical Interactions</em>
peeked
out from under the coverings, which hid the pile of books a little
too well to have been placed entirely by accident.
</p>
<p>
	Theo
glanced once over his shoulder at the door and sat still
for a few seconds, listening for any sounds from outside the room. He
quietly opened the doors of the cabinet and took out an old wooden
trunk. He set it on the corner of his desk and opened it with a
tarnished brass key.
</p>
<p>
	The
trunk was packed to the brim
with jars and
vials.
An
apothecary scale and weights were tucked into one corner. Droppers,
measuring spoons, and
tweezers
were wedged between containers
of variously colored powders and fluids.
</p>
<p>
	On
his forehead Theo wore a pair of bulky, riveted brass aviation
goggles with darkly mirrored lenses that——he had been told——had
once belonged to his grandfather. He brought them down over his eyes.

</p>
<p>
	He
took a
jar containing a bright orange
liquid from
the trunk and placed it upon
the desk.
He
twisted
the lid and
it opened with a pop.
A shudder passed through the fluttering cloud of moths above the
desk, and their movements seemed to take on a new urgency. He took
out a small leather pouch and
tugged
it open to reveal a few teaspoons of flax-colored powder. With
a tiny medicine spoon and a dropper he
set
to work preparing the mechanical apparatus that glinted
dimly between the shadows of the moths.</p>
<p>
	The
apparatus comprised
four steel
rods covered with a network of small copper gutters. At
the narrower end was a jumble of much shorter and narrower rods,
joints, and wires.
</p>
<p>
	The
two halves of the apparatus were separated by a
large
hinge. A
mechanism of fine metal cables and pulleys enabled
bending at the joint. Along the lengths of the rods were hundreds of
tiny
hinged
platforms. From
each of the
platforms,
hoses no thicker than spaghetti emerged to join the gutters. At
intervals along the machine, raised reservoirs were connected to
clear tubes. Several
larger basins jutted at odd angles near the wider end of the machine.
A coil
of brass tubing
wormed down the length of the machine into the tangle of parts at the
narrow end.</p>
<p>
	With
the medicine spoon, Theo placed small piles of the flax-colored
powder onto the platforms. He glanced at a tattered notebook filled
with scrawled diagrams and equations. Not every platform received the
same amount of powder, and some received none at all. To some of the
platforms, he added a drop of dark brown fluid with a dropper. To
others he sprinkled a pinch of bone white powder. He squeezed a drop
of whitish liquid into each of the reservoirs.
</p>
<p >
	He had calculated the amounts
of the ingredients precisely. Any deviation would ruin the execution
of his program. He held his breath as he leaned over his work. He did
not have enough of the flax-colored pollen to waste. A sneeze could
set him back weeks.
</p>
<p >
	At length, he finished. A
complex pattern of yellowish, whitish and brownish piles dotted the
platform assembly of the machine.
</p>
<p>
	Theo
reached into the cabinet and withdrew two
cube-shaped plywood
boxes,
each
with three round holes cut in each side.
The holes were covered with a fine mesh screen. On
each of the boxes a label was affixed. One of them read <em>BLACK
GNATS</em>
and the other read <em>BOG
APHIDS</em>.
An
almost imperceptible buzzing sound emanated from inside each
of the
boxes,
but the tones were different.
Together,
they composed a sound not unlike the hum of electricity.</p>
<p >
	Timing was of the essence in
the next step. Once the gnats and aphids began their circuits, he
would only have few moments to introduce the leonore extract and
activate the moths. The substance had a powerful effect on all the
bugs, and leaving it exposed could have disastrous results.
</p>
<p >
	He slid the lid of the first
box open and a wisp of gnats curled out into the room. The swarm
darkened and expanded over the desk, mingling with the moths.
</p>
<p >
	Theo opened the second box and
a bright green cloud of aphids emerged. The aphids were bigger than
the gnats and the movement of the swarm was less delicate. They too
collected above the desk, adding swirls of green to the expanding
cloud.
</p>
<p>
	The
gnats were
already
responding
to the powder. Theo watched as fine
trails
of gnats curled towards the platforms of the machine. One by one they
struck
their targets. A tiny click sounded each time a wisp of gnats struck
a hinged platform, flipping it like a switch. The clicks came more
rapidly. As combinations of the platform-switches were thrown, tiny
valves on the hoses began to open and close, releasing the whitish
fluid from the reservoirs. As the whitish fluid started to flow, the
aphids reacted.</p>
<p>
	Soon
the
aphids flew
in a bright green blur through
the tubes along the
length of the machine. The clicking sped to a stuttering hum.
</p>
<p>
	Theo
brought out a wooden honey dipper. He dipped the end into the jar of
leonore
extract and stirred it around. He withdrew a deep
pink
ball of the glistening,
sticky substance.</p>
<p>
	With
deft movements, he passed the dipper over each of the jutting basins,
letting a single gooey drop fall into each of them. Then
he quickly replaced the lid of the leonore jar.</p>
<p>
	The
leonore
flowed into the system. A
faint
odor arose as it
came into contact with the whitish fluid. It smelled like sweet,
burnt
cloves. The moths shot to the ends of their tethers like spores on
the head of a dandelion, then dove into action.
</p>
<p>
	The
movement of the moths was deliberate and
complex. They flew in a tightly choreographed dance, their tethers
braiding and unbraiding
repeatedly.
The tethers
tugged at tiny spindles.
They
popped switches
open just
as
other moths struck them
shut. They pushed  bolts into housings and snapping them back out.
A
clattering racket rose
over the hum
of
the gnats and the whirr
of the aphids.
</p>
<p>
	The
tangle of tubes, wires and rods at the narrow end of the apparatus
twitched.
Theo cautiously raised his goggles to get a better look.</p>
<p>
	The
knot of parts twitched again and began to loosen. Slowly, with
jitters and jerks, the bundle began to unfold like a strange
mechanical flower blooming. Theo stared.
</p>
<p >
	Suddenly, it snapped open into
the shape of a hand, with fingers and thumb fully extended.</p>
<p >
	Theo's eyes widened as he
watched the movements of the mechanical hand. Blurry green veins of
aphids coursed through the fine brass pipework of the fingers. The
flanged knuckles bent and straightened jerkily, responding to rods in
the forearm. These in turn were driven by the complex interactions of
the moths.
</p>
<p >
	Theo took a porous, gray stone
from the trunk. A tremor rippled through the swarm of moths. He
brought the stone closer to the twitching, skeletal hand.
</p>
<p >
	With a sudden and deliberate
motion, the hand grasped the stone. Theo stepped back. The hand
continued to grip the stone. A smile of satisfaction crept across
Theo's face. This was it.
</p>
<p >
	“Theo!” came his father's
voice.
</p>
<p >
	Theo froze for a second then
scrambled in all directions at once, knocking the trunk off the desk
and spilling its contents all over the floor. The bugs went wild.
Aphids and gnats fell out of formation and filled the room.</p>
<p >
	“Wait!” Theo blurted. “I'm
coming!”</p>
<p >
	“Where are you?” called
his father from down the hall.
</p>
<p >
	There was no time to try to
collect the bugs. Theo dashed to the window and flung it open. He
swung his arms frantically to clear the room.
</p>
<p >
	“Coming dad!”</p>
<p >
	His father's footsteps
approached. The gnats and aphids hung in lazy clouds throughout the
room. Theo grabbed a blanket from his bed and whipped it wildly,
sending the bugs into swirling eddies around the room.
</p>
<p >
	The door cracked open. Theo
grabbed the mechanical arm and flung it to the floor beneath his
desk, moths and all. He swung the blanket in one last wide arc
through the air and threw it over the mess of bottles, moths and
machinery at his feet. A tattered cloud of aphids and gnats still
hung inside the window. The door opened fully and they dispersed in a
puff as Rudy Promovendis peeked into the room.</p>
<p >
	“Theo?”
</p>
<p >
	Rudy was a tall, thin man with
a shock of bright red hair even more unkempt and willful than his
son's and an enormous, bushy mustache to match it. Like his son his
eyes were green and sharp, though they had a greater tendency to
wander as their owner became lost in thought. Theo had often wondered
whether his own ability to focus on one thing at a time had been the
one trait he had inherited from his mother.
</p>
<p >
	Rudy held a crumpled bundle of
blueprints in one hand and a pencil in the other. He scribbled notes
as he nudged the door open with his shoulder.
</p>
<p >
	“Ready to go?” he said
without looking up.
</p>
<p >
	“Go?” Theo tried to slow
his breathing. The last of the gnats disappeared just as Rudy raised
his head.</p>
<p >
	“To help me with the
harvester. Don't you remember?” said Rudy.
</p>
<p >
	“You said we'd do that
Saturday!” Theo said.</p>
<p >
	“Saturday?” Rudy's eyes
drifted downward in thought and he sucked on the end of his mustache.
“Isn't it Saturday today?”</p>
<p >
	“No, dad, it's Friday. And
there's the festival in town!” said Theo.</p>
<p >
	“Ah,” said Rudy. “I
guess I meant Friday then. We'd better get to it while it's still
early!”</p>
<p >
	“What about the festival?”
said Theo.</p>
<p >
	“All the more reason not to
dawdle!” said Rudy, turning to leave. “I'll be waiting up at the
shelter.”</p>
<p >
	Theo was about to complain
when he heard a loud tap above his head. One of the moths was banging
against the light bulb, its long black tether dangling free.
</p>
<p >
	Rudy stopped in the doorway
and slowly turned back around to face the room. Theo grabbed the
tether and pulled the moth behind his back, hoping his father hadn't
noticed.
</p>
<p >
	Rudy sniffed at the air and
looked around.
</p>
<p >
	“Say, you haven't been into
my pollens have you?” he said.</p>
<p >
	Theo stared blankly.</p>
<p >
	“Me?”</p>
<p >
	Rudy's brows knitted for a
moment.
</p>
<p >
	“Hmm,” he said, then
turned back to the door, his attention turning back to the bundle of
blueprints. “Chop chop!”</p>
