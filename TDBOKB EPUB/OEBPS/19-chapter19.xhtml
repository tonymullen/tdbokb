  <p>
  	Mr.
  Cess's mansion was well equipped for experimental and constructive
  pursuits of all varieties. Among its many rooms were fully-stocked
  metallurgy, woodworking and glassblowing studios. Cess could modestly
  boast a hard-won level of competence in all of these disciplines. He
  had honed his skills through years of building other people's
  inventions. Lazy he was not.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Mr. Cess's experimental
  laboratory was located down a spiral staircase in the corner of his
  office. The laboratory was stocked with shelves upon shelves of
  chemicals. It had faucets and nozzles for water, oxygen, hydrogen,
  helium, liquid nitrogen and sulfuric acid. A wide selection of other
  gasses and liquids were available in pressurized canisters. Metal
  cupboards and drawers overflowed with wires, electrodes, pith balls,
  heavy-duty batteries, and electromagnetic coils. Hooks on the wall
  held every kind of tool imaginable, from hacksaws to circuit testers.
  Cess's beloved slide-rule, the very one that had saved his young
  life, hung in a special place beside his framed Certificate of
  Commendation for Exceptional Scientific Genius from the mayor.
  </p>
  <p>
  	A very special tray of
  pollens, plant extracts, and insect secretions was arranged next to
  the broad metal workbench. Upon the workbench, motionless but for the
  occasional twitch, lay Bea.</p>
  <p>
  	Cess studied the plans for the
  harvester's bug drive. He wore a white lab coat and held a beaker
  full of red-orange fluid. Ballhatchet and Dooley stood at attention.
  They wore blue-green scrubs.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“This should liven things up
  a bit,” muttered Cess, inserting an eyedropper into the beaker and
  filling it with the fluid.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Ballhatchet and Dooley watched
  Cess bend forward to administer the fluid. For a moment, Bea did not
  react.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Suddenly, a cloud of gnats
  emerged from the sides of Bea's head and the fireflies in her eyes
  flickered and twitched.</p>
  <p>
  	“This doesn't seem quite
  right,” said Cess to himself. Then louder, he said, “Ballhatchet!
  Dandelion!”</p>
  <p>
  	“Which was the dandelion
  again?” said Ballhatchet.</p>
  <p>
  	“The yellow one, you idiot!”
  hissed Dooley.</p>
  <p>
  	“Whitish!” said Cess.</p>
  <p>
  	“Ah! Got it,” said
  Ballhatchet. He handed Cess an eyedropper filled with whitish fluid.
  “I still don't see how this doll is like a harvester.”	</p>
  <p>
  	“Shut up, Ballhatchet,”
  said Dooley. “Mr. Cess is trying to concentrate!”</p>
  <p>
  	“What, I'm not bothering
  him,” said Ballhatchet. “Am I bothering you, Mr. Cess?”</p>
  <p>
  	Cess rolled his eyes and
  applied the whitish fluid.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Suddenly, Bea sat bolt
  upright. The bugs buzzed loudly and circulated in full force. Their
  motion was rapid and they flowed in tight formation over Bea's whole
  body. Bea reached towards the tray of pollens and extracts.
  Ballhatchet pulled the tray away.</p>
  <p>
  	“Whoa there! That's not for
  you!”</p>
  <p>
  	Bea leaped off the table and
  began grabbing at everything she could. Cess raced ahead of her to
  protect the rows of beakers on the counter. 	</p>
  <p>
  	“Now, just a moment!” he
  said. “Hold on there!”</p>
  <p>
  	But Bea was off and running.
  She ran under the table. Her bugs shrieked. Ballhatchet dove to grab
  her but missed, crashing into a closet full of beakers and tubes. Bea
  shot straight into the air, launched like a ball from a cannon of
  bugs. She bounced like rubber from the ceiling and somersaulted to
  the ground. The insects made a chattering, clucking sound.</p>
  <p>
  	“She's laughing!” said
  Ballhatchet, pulling himself to his feet.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Indeed, Bea seemed to be
  enjoying herself. She ran in circles and shook her arms and head. She
  grabbed a cable attached to a large oscilloscope and shook it. The
  oscilloscope toppled to the ground with a crash and its cathode ray
  tube exploded in a burst of flame. Everyone froze and stared at the
  mess, including Bea. She broke into sobbing movements and the buzzing
  of her insects became a piercing wail.</p>
  <p>
  	“Oh dear,” said Cess.
  </p>
  <p>
  	It was Dooley's idea to duct
  tape her to the table. With great effort they managed to secure her
  to the table in a mad cocoon of tape, but this only made the insects
  more agitated. Though Bea's limbs were pinned, the movement of the
  bugs made it seem she was flailing more wildly than ever. A burst of
  gnats struck Dooley full in the face with the force of a fist. A moth
  the size of robin's egg pelted Ballhatchet smack in the eye.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Ow!” cried Ballhatchet.</p>
  <p>
  	Cess scrambled to get the tray
  of pollens and extracts into some kind of order. Powders and liquids
  were spilled all over the tray and mingled haphazardly. A thin wisp
  of greenish smoke rose from the tray. In a panic, Cess took off his
  white lab coat and tried to extinguish whatever was emitting the
  smoke, but this only succeeded in mingling the chemicals further. He
  gave up. He dove under the table and cowered under the workbench as
  the room filled with a furious, chaotic hurricane of bugs.
  Ballhatchet and Dooley followed soon after. The three of them huddled
  together under the metal table, hoping for the banging above to
  subside.</p>
  <p>
  	“Blast!” said Cess.</p>
  <p>
  	“I didn't think it looked
  much like a harvester,” said Ballhatchet. “I think you might have
  the manuals mixed up.”</p>
  <p>
  	Cess seethed silently.</p>
  <p>
  	“That kid seemed pretty
  handy with it,” said Ballhatchet.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Ballhatchet, will you shut
  it already?” exclaimed Dooley. “Can't you see Mr. Cess is trying
  to think? Good grief! What I wouldn't give to have a partner who
  wasn't a complete idiot for a change!”</p>
  <p>
  	Cess pondered Dooley's
  comment.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Indeed,” he said.

  <p>
  	Mayor
  Digniggleby sat alone in his study. From the walls, awards and
  accolades seemed to mock him. <em>The
  Annual Mossville Award For Outstanding Contributions to the Municipal
  Benefit</em>,
  photographs of himself being flattered by dignitaries, ribbons and
  certificates too numerous to mention in honor of the Suction-Flux
  Hydro-Debogilator. His eyes fell on the framed photograph of his
  inauguration day, propped up on the desk. He reached over and placed
  it face down.
  </p>
  <p>
  	That wasn't enough. He took
  the picture in his hands. He stood up and collected the memorabilia
  from the walls, the desk, and the shelves of the study. He pulled an
  old trunk out of the corner, opened it and dumped everything in.
  </p>
  <p>
  	At the bottom of the trunk a
  yellowed piece of paper caught his eye. He dug down and picked it up.</p>
  <p>
  	On the paper was a simple
  drawing of an oval. It was the very one that he had presented at the
  patent office that fateful day so long ago. Digniggleby looked at the
  paper for a long, long time.
  </p>

  <p>
  	Cess sat alone in the darkness
  of his office. His face was welted and bug-bitten. The sound of
  buzzing and rattling in the laboratory below was muffled through the
  floor.
  </p>
  <p>
  	On
  the desk in front of him stood a large magnetic tape editor made of
  Bakelite and bronze. From either side of the editor extended a metal
  arm holding a reel. Between the reels and through the tape-head at
  the base of the editor ran a length of audio tape. A curled,
  tuba-shaped speaker extended from the middle part of the editor. Cess
  pushed a little lever right and left to wind the audio tape forward
  and back. He skipped from snippet to snippet as the tinny sound of
  Rudy Promovendis's voice emerged amid the hiss from the speaker:
  <em>...I'm going
  to change the world...You leave my son out...he is not involved in my
  work...if you're trying to steal my inventi...</em></p>
  <p>
  	Cess smiled to himself. He
  pressed down on the editor's blade and cut the tape.
