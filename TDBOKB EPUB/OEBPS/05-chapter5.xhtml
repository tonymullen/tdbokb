  <p>
  	Rudy worked silently on the
  harvester. Theo sat nearby, holding the toad in front of his own face
  and frowning at it. From time to time Rudy extended his hand for some
  tool or other and Theo passed it to him. Theo always knew which tool
  Rudy needed without having to be told.</p>
  <p>
  	“It's
  always the same,” Theo complained. “I get in trouble and it's not
  my fault.”</p>
  <p>
  	Rudy stopped working, but
  didn't look up for several long seconds. Then he turned to Theo.</p>
  <p>
  	“Not your fault?” he
  asked. “The time you were caught with your pockets full of ball
  bearings wasn't your fault? The time they brought you in with a
  gyroscope stuffed down the front of your trousers wasn't your fault?
  Whose fault is it that you can't keep your hands from taking what you
  haven't paid for?”</p>
  <p>
  	Theo looked at his father with
  a pained expression.</p>
  <p>
  	“Why do you always take
  their side?” he asked. “It's bad enough that those stupid people
  think they're better than everyone.”</p>
  <p>
  	Rudy winced.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Don't you talk about Mayor
  Digniggleby that way!” he commanded.</p>
  <p>
  	“Why not?” said Theo.
  “That's what he is. He’s like a big, fat clown. And Valerie
  Digniggleby, ew!”</p>
  <p>
  	Theo scrunched his face in
  disgust. “I don't know why everybody thinks he's so great.”</p>
  <p>
  	Rudy thrust his face into
  Theo's angrily.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Mayor Digniggleby saved
  this town. You don't know what it was like back then!”</p>
  <p>
  	Rudy knew he could never
  convey the disaster to his son. The youngster could know the facts,
  but he  could never know what it was like to be there. What it was
  like to lose so much so suddenly.</p>
  <p>
  	“If it hadn't been for the
  mayor's work, more people would have died,” he said. “Enough
  people died as it was!”</p>
  <p>
  	Rudy remembered the love and
  desperation on his mother's soot-black face when she burst through
  the flaming doorway at the moment he had seen her last. He remembered
  the horrible burbling of the mud as it consumed his father's work
  shed. Such violence, such abruptness. These weren't things Theo could
  ever understand. Truth be told, Rudy hoped Theo never would
  understand them. Theo had enough sadness of his own.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Rudy shook his head to clear
  out the memories.</p>
  <p>
  	“People love the mayor
  because of what he gave them. You ought to think about that.”</p>
  <p>
  	Theo sat quietly, his eyes
  cast down. He glanced glumly at his toad.  	</p>

<p>
  	The Mossville Municipal Office
  of Patent Registration and Processing was a wide, low building a few
  blocks away from the town square. The most notable thing about the
  patent office was the very large, very crooked house that seemed to
  float in the air about fifty feet above the main building. The house
  was supported by a cockeyed lattice of stilts and beams, up the
  center of which ran a wooden elevator shaft.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The house was wooden and
  weathered, and elegant in a way that a lunatic might have
  appreciated. It was a haphazard collection of balconies, gables,
  rooftops, and annexes tossed together in a towering, top-heavy heap.
  It had at least five or six stories, but its unconventional shape
  made it impossible to say how many exactly.</p>
  <p>
  	One long balcony looked out
  over the city. From another balcony extended a narrow, rickety
  maintenance catwalk that connected directly about a quarter of the
  way up the shaft of the Suction-Flux Hydro-Debogilator.</p>
  <p>
  	Just outside the door of one
  of the house's uppermost annexes stood a platform just big enough for
  one person to stand on at once. A small gondola composed of a
  vertical steel bar with a wooden bucket on the end was poised over
  the platform. From above the platform a system of gondola cables
  extended to a tall pole at the outskirts of Mossville and then
  further on to another pole well outside of the city. The cables
  extended further still into the haze in the direction of the ravine
  beyond the distant rocky ridge.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The house was the residence of
  Horace Cess, and the uppermost annex was his private office. He sat
  there now among the cabinets and bookshelves. Rolls of blueprints and
  plans formed a dense honeycomb in their racks against the wall. On
  the desk, paper and folders formed perfectly aligned but precariously
  high stacks. Next to the stacks sat a wood and metal intercom and a
  small copper and tin device, about the size of a pencil case, from
  which extended two metal arms. On each arm was a small reel, and
  between the two reels ran a narrow brown magnetic audio tape that
  wound through the device. From one side of the device extended a
  small, trumpet-shaped brass microphone.
  </p>
  <p>
  	A buzz sounded from the
  intercom. Mr. Cess pressed the button irritably.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“The mayor is here to see
  you,” came the voice of Mr. Cess's secretary.</p>
  <p>
  	“Send him up!” said Mr.
  Cess. He reached across the desk and switched the recording device
  on. It clicked softly and the reels began to turn.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Mayor Digniggleby entered and
  took a seat. Mr. Cess sat behind his broad desk in an imposing
  high-backed leather chair. He idly organized the pencils on his desk,
  adjusting them repeatedly to be ever more parallel. The mayor sat in
  front of the desk in a small wooden chair that seemed ready to pop
  into splinters under his weight.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I, for one, was not
  impressed,” said Mr. Cess.</p>
  <p>
  	“E-excuse me?” said Mayor
  Digniggleby.</p>
  <p>
  	“Your so-called speech,”
  said Mr. Cess. “You call that celebratory? You'd think twenty years
  as a hero to the masses would have endowed you with some rhetorical
  flair! I can only imagine what kind of noodle you'd be if you weren't
  universally adored!”</p>
  <p>
  	Mayor Digniggleby winced.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I did try,” he said.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Mr. Cess rolled his eyes.</p>
  <p>
  	“Regardless,” he said.
  “What we need to talk about  is the baron.”</p>
  <p>
  	“Oh dear,” said Mayor
  Digniggleby. “Have you any idea how many sheep that man has?”</p>
  <p>
  	“I don't care how many sheep
  he has,” said Mr. Cess. “We need the land. He must have tax
  issues.”</p>
  <p>
  	“I don't know if I'm
  comfortable with this,” said Mayor Digniggleby. “What do we need
  all that land for again, anyway?”</p>
  <p>
  	“Municipal projects!” Mr.
  Cess practically shrieked. “Do  I have to spell everything out for
  you? What a question! As if one could ever have enough land!”</p>
  <p>
  	“Well, I——” began
  Mayor Digniggleby.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Arrange a meeting with the
  Baron,” interrupted Mr. Cess. “If I can't count on you, I don't
  know what the point is of any of this!”</p>
  <p>
  	“A-any of this?” repeated
  Mayor Digniggleby, his voice nearly a whisper.</p>
  <p>
  	Cess leaned forward over his
  desk and glowered down at Mayor Digniggleby.</p>
  <p>
  	“Twenty years is a long,
  long time to be hog-tied by the incompetence of another person,” he
  hissed. “After all I've done for you!”</p>
  <p>
  	Mayor Digniggleby's bit his
  lip. His jowls trembled.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I-I understand Mr. Cess,”
  he said. “I'll do my best.”</p>
