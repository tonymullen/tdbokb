	<p>
		The
	festivities were just beginning when Theo reached the center of
	Mossville. The town square was festooned with lanterns and ribbons
	and the crowd was thick. Theo had run all the way from the hills and
	by the time he got to the square he was so out of breath he could
	scarcely stand upright.
	</p>
	<p>
		The square was a broad
	cobblestone plaza surrounded by faded baroque facades. In other times
	and other light, the facades had been pink and green and blue, but
	now they were only shades of the dusty violet sky. Narrow streets and
	even narrower alleys led from the square into the maze of the town
	center. Stone buildings hundreds of years old jostled with newer
	wooden houses. In a quirk of Mossville architecture, the upper floors
	of the houses extended several feet beyond their ground floors,
	supported by heavy wooden struts, lending them an odd, unbalanced
	appearance. Red-tiled roofs were stacked one upon the next and a
	network of gutters and vines made it difficult to determine where one
	building ended and the next began. Wrought iron gas lamps——some
	affixed to lampposts and others ensconced on building walls——cast
	their flickering orange light over the crowd. People spilled out from
	the square into the snaking alleys and strained to see the
	festivities.
	</p>
	<p>
		A stage was set up in the
	northeast corner of the square, where the ribbons that decorated the
	square came together in an extravaganza of bunting and bows. Over the
	stage hung a huge purple banner with the words <em>MAYOR
	MERIWEATHER DIGNIGGLEBY – HERO OF MOSSVILLE</em>
	written in sparkling gold lettering. On stage, a full brass band of
	schoolchildren performed a spirited selection of triumphant
	standards.
	</p>
	<p>
		Behind the stage rose a dark
	shape that, at first glance, resembled nothing so much as a monstrous
	tree trunk. It was at least ten meters across and extended hundreds
	of meters into the sky. Upon a moment's inspection it was obvious the
	object was no tree. It was an enormous system of pipes, pumps, hoses
	and valves, all woven into a gigantic cylinder. The cylinder emerged
	from the cobbled ground of the square and soared up in a great arcing
	parabola that disappeared in the evening darkness. Its upper reaches
	were intermittently lit by fireworks. A deep, throbbing hum emanated
	from the structure and its shape pulsated in time with the hum.
	</p>
	<p>
		It was no accident the stage
	had been positioned in front of this mechanical behemoth. This was
	the Suction-Flux Hydro-Debogilator, and it was thanks to it that the
	town of Mossville had anything to celebrate at all.</p>
	<p>
		Theo squeezed through the
	audience, looking for a good place to watch the event. He was just a
	few yards from the stage, but the crowd was dense and the people were
	tall. Even when he jumped up and down, he could not get a glimpse of
	the activity on stage. A stout man shifted his weight and pushed Theo
	face-first into the broad bottom of a matronly woman who turned and
	swung her purse at Theo.</p>
	<p>
		“Ragamuffin!” she shouted.</p>
	<p>
		“Sorry!” cried Theo and
	ducked away.</p>
	<p>
		Theo spied a ledge lined with
	flower boxes on the second story of a house not far from the stage.
	The corner of the ledge looked just big enough to sit on. A rusty
	gutter rose up the side of the house at an angle, and a patch of ivy
	clung to the wall near the ledge. Theo hopped onto the gutter and
	shimmied up. He scrambled across the ivy and began to hoist himself
	up onto the ledge, then he stopped.</p>
	<p>
		Atop the ledge sat a brown
	toad about the size of Theo's fist. It sat smack in the spot where
	Theo had hoped to sit. It gazed at Theo with disinterest.
	</p>
	<p>
		Theo strained to hold himself
	up. His belly leaned against the ledge, one foot was planted in the
	ivy, and one foot dangled freely without a foothold. He waved his
	head at the toad.</p>
	<p>
		“Scoot!” he said.
	</p>
	<p>
		The toad blinked, but did not
	move.</p>
	<p>
		Theo sighed. He settled on his
	elbows. It wasn't comfortable, but at least he could see. 	</p>
	<p>
		In front of the stage, the
	esteemed Constable Fleabo of the Mossville Municipal Police
	Department stood at attention with his team of policemen, a thin blue
	line to protect the evening's guests of honor from any rabble that
	might happen to become aroused. On the stage the guests of honor were
	assembled under the glare of spotlights. Mayor Meriweather
	Digniggleby, the man of the hour, stood center stage, glancing
	nervously from side to side. Mayor Digniggleby was a short, spherical
	man with no hair on his head save for two perplexed tufts for
	eyebrows and a cloud of ash-blond fuzz around his ears. He wore a
	white suit with a pink cummerbund that seemed to rise almost to his
	chin, leaving just enough room for a matching bow tie that was so
	tightly fixed to his ample neck it threatened to cut off his
	circulation. He wore a carnation in his lapel that matched the
	cummerbund, the tie, and indeed his very pink head itself. With
	apparent effort, he held his mouth in the shape of a broad smile, but
	his eyes made no such pretensions.</p>
	<p>
		Beside him stood his wife
	Cynthia and their twelve-year-old daughter Valerie. Cynthia
	Digniggleby was a tall, lean woman who towered over her husband and
	wore a look of perpetual disdain on her heavily made-up face. Her
	hair was done up in a perfectly rigid bouffant. Around her neck she
	wore a bushy, loosely knotted fox shawl which still retained its head
	and paws as decoration. Her handbag, too, blurred the line between
	fashion and taxidermy, being composed of an intact cross-section of
	an alligator's tail. The rest of her furs were mercifully free of
	identifying features, but it was clear that many minks had given
	their lives in the service of her apparel.
	</p>
	<p>
		Valerie Digniggleby's style
	was less ostentatious than her mother's but no less meticulous. She
	wore a pink and beige polka-dotted dress with a matching beige
	petticoat. Her hat, purse and gloves were matching pink. Her hat was
	round with a narrow, upturned brim. The hat was decorated with a
	cluster of roses and bows——pink of course——and the blonde
	braids that fell over her shoulders were tied with matching ribbons.
	She stood upright with her feet together in beige patent leather
	shoes. She held an uncharacteristically worn doll firmly to her
	chest.</p>
	<p>
		The expression on Valerie's
	face was something very near to angelic, the very picture of filial
	decorum. But from time to time, a momentary sharpness in her eyes as
	she glanced around the stage betrayed a restlessness that was
	altogether at odds with her overall demeanor.
	</p>
	<p>
		A few feet behind and to the
	left of the family stood a tall, gaunt figure, half-lit by the
	spotlight. He was attired in a worn dark suit of indeterminable color
	and gripped the ball of a black cane, although his stiff, upright
	stance indicated he needed no support. His head and shoulders were
	only dimly visible beyond the penumbra of the spotlight. His deep-set
	eyes were visible only as two long, downward-pointing triangular
	shadows under a stern, overhanging brow. His head was wreathed in
	sparse, wiry gray hair. Even with his face in shadow he exuded an air
	of scorn.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not many among the crowd would
	have recognized the figure to be Horace E. Cess, Chief Patent
	Administrator of the Mossville Municipal Office of Patent
	Registration and Processing. Fewer still would have thought to wonder
	why he shared the stage with the celebrated Digniggleby family. Those
	who did recognize Mr. Cess might well have wondered, but they would
	have had the good sense to keep their questions to themselves.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the front of the stage, Mr.
	Cess' assistants Ballhatchet and Dooley stood before an tarnished,
	boxy microphone atop a short stand. Ballhatchet was a hulk of a man.
	He stood well over six and a half feet tall, with a wedge-shaped body
	that tapered downwards from his massive shoulders, upon which his
	disproportionately small head sat like an orange with a pompadour on
	a refrigerator. Dooley couldn't have been more than half the height
	of Ballhatchet. His body shape was nearly the precise opposite of
	Ballhatchet's. He resembled a dollop of whipped cream with his pointy
	head, spreading midsection, and short, widely-set legs. The two
	assistants wore matching black suits.</p>
	<p>
		On the stage, Ballhatchet and
	Dooley seemed to be arguing about something. Dooley held a thick,
	stubby hand up over the microphone while trying to grab what looked
	like a crumpled piece of paper away from Ballhatchet, who held it
	just out of Dooley's reach. Dooley cast a glance in the direction of
	Mr. Cess, who nodded from the shadow. When the band children
	completed the rousing finale of their medley, Dooley stomped on
	Ballhatchet's foot and grabbed the paper. He nudged Ballhatchet
	roughly out of the spotlight and stepped forward to the mic.</p>
	<p>
		Dooley tapped the mic and the
	sound boomed across the town square, followed by a squeal of
	feedback. He fumbled with the crumpled paper, cleared his throat
	loudly into the microphone, and began to read.</p>
	<p>
		“Ladies and gentlemen, we
	are——” he began, then squinted at the paper with a puzzled
	expression. He shot an irritated sidelong glance at Ballhatchet, who
	mouthed a word to him. Dooley continued to read haltingly, “<em>gathered</em>
	here this evening to pay tribute to the hero of our time.”</p>
	<p>
		Dooley continued to read,
	looking over at Ballhatchet for support on every fifth word or so.</p>
	<p>
		Theo's elbows hurt. The toad
	just stared at him.</p>
	<p>
		“When Mossville faced its
	greatest crisis 20 years ago,” read Dooley, “one man, endowed
	with a genius beyond the comprehension of ordinary people, rescued
	the city from a horrific fate. To Mayor Meriweather  Digniggleby, for
	his brilliant invention of the Suction-Flux Hydro-Debogilator, we
	humbly extend our deepest, lasting gratitude.”</p>
	<p>
		As he said the name of the
	machine, he gestured at the towering structure behind the stage. The
	crowd applauded. Calls of “speech!” rose throughout the square.
	</p>
	<p>
		Mayor Digniggleby stepped to
	the microphone, nodding uncomfortably at Dooley. He stood for a
	moment, blinking as though he had no idea how he had gotten there. He
	tried to clear his throat but hiccuped at the same time, resulting in
	a stifled, slightly painful sounding gagging noise. At last he spoke.</p>
	<p>
		“I... uh,” he began.
	“Thank you so much. You're entirely too kind. I'm very grateful for
	all of the, uh, gratitude.”</p>
	<p>
		A solemn hush enveloped the
	crowd.
	</p>
	<p>
		“Indeed, what happened,
	or... nearly happened to our lovely town those years ago was... It
	was bad. Very, very bad. No doubt about it. It was, er, would have
	been, uh, very bad indeed. It could have been worse than it was, that
	is. Which is to say very bad. Indeed.”</p>
	<p>
		The crowd hung on every word.
	All eyes were on the Mayor.</p>
	<p>
		“But the truth is...” he
	continued, then paused. His jowls trembled. Beads of sweat dotted his
	forehead.</p>
	<p>
		If anyone had been watching
	Mr. Cess, they could not have failed to notice an almost electric
	jolt in his posture when he heard these words. His head snapped in
	the direction of the mayor like a bird of prey and he leaned in so
	stiffly and at such an angle that his body seemed almost to defy
	gravity. Digniggleby glanced towards Mr. Cess and winced.</p>
	<p>
		“The truth <em>is</em>
	that the important thing is everybody's okay now and the bog is where
	it belongs, far away,” he blurted.
	</p>
	<p>
		The crowd cheered. The band
	struck up a vigorous march.
	</p>
	<p>
		For reasons known only to
	itself, the toad on the ledge chose this moment to leap.
	</p>
	<p>
		“Hey!” cried Theo.
	</p>
	<p>
		The toad landed square on the
	top hat of a gentleman below. No sooner had the startled man looked
	up than the toad hopped again, this time directly into the crowded
	square.
	</p>
	<p>
		Theo's stomach rose. The toad
	couldn't possibly last more than a few seconds in that crowd. Theo
	pictured the bad end it would surely come to on the cobbles of the
	square. He squeezed his eyes shut to banish the thought. With a
	rueful glance at the comfortable perch that would now go to waste, he
	swung himself down the ivy covered wall and dove into the crowd after
	the toad.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now that he was no longer
	trying to watch the action up above, Theo could move quickly among
	the legs. He scurried in the direction of the toad's disappearance.</p>
	<p>
		There it was, a motionless
	dark blob amid a sea of feet. The feet, however, were far from
	motionless. Boots, pumps, Oxfords and clogs hailed down from all
	directions around the toad. A booted foot came down smack on the spot
	where the frog sat and Theo recoiled. He looked up to see the foot
	rise, with no sign of the toad underneath. A few yards away the
	movement of a dark blob landing on the ground caught Theo's eye. The
	toad had jumped away, miraculously unsmushed. Theo dashed after it,
	bumping legs and buckling knees as he went. He ignored the annoyed
	mutters and shouts that arose in his wake.</p>
	<p>
		At last he caught up with the
	toad. He pushed past a fat man in a coat and tails who happened to be
	checking the time on his pocket watch. Theo dove after the toad. The
	toad jumped, but too late. Theo caught it in one hand and brought it
	close.</p>
	<p>
		“Got you!” he said.</p>
	<p>
		But Theo had gotten something
	else as well. Without his noticing, a stray thread from the sleeve of
	his worn sweater had caught itself on the chain of the fat man's
	pocket watch. When Theo had leaped after the toad, the watch had
	leaped after him.
	</p>
	<p>
		“Thief! Pickpocket!”
	shouted the fat man. “Alert the authorities!”</p>
	<p>
		For a moment, Theo had no idea
	the commotion had anything to do with him. He held the toad to his
	chest, cupped in both hands. He looked around to see what the fuss
	was about. The fat man was pointing straight at him.
	</p>
	<p>
		“Stop him! Accost that
	rapscallion!” roared the fat man. Others began to take notice. A
	panic rippled through the crowd around Theo.
	</p>
	<p>
		“A thief!” he heard
	someone say.</p>
	<p>
		“Cover your goods!” said
	someone else.</p>
	<p>
		“Let's get him!” said
	still another.
	</p>
	<p>
		At once, the crowd seemed to
	descend upon him. In a panic, Theo ducked back down among the legs
	and scrambled away.
	</p>
	<p>
		Theo had not realized how
	close he was to the stage, but now he burst through the front of the
	crowd to find himself face to face with the line of Mossville's
	finest. The commotion in the crowd had roused Constable Fleabo, whose
	head now whipped this this way and that in an effort to identify the
	problem.</p>
	<p>
		“Nothing to see here!”
	shouted Constable Fleabo reflexively. “Everything is under
	control!”</p>
	<p>
		Theo dove back into the crowd.

	</p>
	<p>
		The panic had reached the
	stage. Ballhatchet and Dooley stood back-to-back and assumed
	defensive Kung-Fu positions. The brass band descended into cacophony.
	Cynthia Digniggleby clapped her hands over Valerie's eyes.</p>
	<p>
		“I want to see!” cried
	Valerie.</p>
	<p>
		“You most certainly do not!”
	replied her mother. “You'll have nightmares for a week! Do
	something Meriweather!”</p>
	<p>
		Mayor Digniggleby stood
	paralyzed with confusion.	</p>
	<p>
		“D-do...?” he babbled.</p>
	<p>
		Constable Fleabo waded into
	the roiling crowd. A few moments later he reappeared, dragging Theo
	by the collar. Theo kicked and struggled helplessly.
	</p>
	<p>
		“What do we have here?”
	asked Constable Fleabo.</p>
	<p>
		“I didn't do anything!”
	cried Theo.</p>
	<p>
		Valerie wrestled free of her
	mother and ran to the front of the stage, fascinated by the hubbub.
	</p>
	<p>
		Theo and Valerie's eyes met.
	For just a fleeting instant, Theo thought he saw something in those
	eyes he could trust. He felt a flush of hope. He looked at Valerie
	imploringly.
	</p>
	<p>
		As quickly as Theo's hope had
	appeared, it was gone. Valerie's face clouded as if she had caught
	herself doing something embarrassing. She stuck her tongue out and
	blew Theo a fat, wet raspberry. 	</p>
