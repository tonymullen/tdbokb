  <h1>A Well-Intentioned Confession and a Forceful Response</h1>

  </div>


  <p>
  	A
  crowd had gathered around the platform in the town square. Constable
  Fleabo and Deputy Deepak stood at either corner of the front of the
  platform. Mayor Digniggleby made his way through the crowd to the
  platform, accompanied by Cynthia and Valerie.</p>
  <p>
  	“Meriweather, what are you
  planning to say?” whispered Cynthia. “I demand that you tell me!”</p>
  <p>
  	“Trust me, Cynthia,” said
  Digniggleby. “It has to be this way.”</p>
  <p>
  	“What's he doing?” asked
  Valerie to her mother.</p>
  <p>
  	“I don't know, honey,”
  said Cynthia.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Mayor Digniggleby climbed the
  steps to the platform.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“You two wait here. I have
  to do this myself,” he said.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Mayor Digniggleby stood in the
  middle of the stage and adjusted the microphone stand to his height.
  He tapped loudly on the microphone and cleared his throat.</p>
  <p>
  	“Ladies and gentlemen,” he
  said. “There is a matter that has weighed heavily on my heart. I
  have a terrible confession to make.” He sniffled and scrunched up
  his face, then composed himself and continued, “I am not who you
  think I am.”</p>
  <p>
  	A murmur rose from the crowd.
  Valerie and Cynthia looked at each other nervously.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“That is to say, I <em>am</em>
  who you think I am. But... I haven't done what you think I've done,”
  Digniggleby stammered. He took a deep breath. “I did not invent the
  Suction-Flux Hydro Debogilator.”</p>
  <p>
  	A gasp rose from the crowd.
  Cynthia's mouth moved silently, as if it were searching for the words
  to explain what she had just heard. Valerie wrinkled her brow deeply.</p>
  <p>
  	“The only thing I ever
  invented was this,” said Digniggleby. He held the drawing of an
  oval up humbly with both hands before his chest. “It's a
  paperweight. It's oblong. It's, uh, made of soap.”</p>
  <p>
  	The murmuring of the crowd
  increased.</p>
  <p>
  	“I humbly submit it to you,”
  said Digniggleby. “But I do understand if you don't feel it's
  enough to warrant my continued service as your mayor.”</p>
  <p>
  	Suddenly, Cess's voice boomed
  out from the back of the crowd.</p>
  <p>
  	“Outrageous!” thundered
  Cess as he strode through the crowd towards the stage, his little
  entourage in tow. Theo walked alongside Cess, jogging every few steps
  to keep up, and Bea ran alongside Theo.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Oh, Mr. Cess,” sputtered
  Digniggleby. “I'm sorry. I simply can't——”</p>
  <p>
  	A group of automatons had
  already mounted the stage. Before Digniggleby could finish his
  sentence they flung a canvas sack over his head, muffling his words.</p>
  <p>
  	Cess flew up the steps to the
  stage.</p>
  <p>
  	“I think we have heard quite
  enough!” he spoke into the microphone. “As Chief Patent
  Administrator and second in line to the mayorship of Mossville I
  hereby declare a state of emergency! Constable Fleabo, please stand
  by in case my men require your assistance!”</p>
  <p>
  	The automatons descended on
  Cynthia and Valerie with canvas sacks.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Goodness!” exclaimed
  Cynthia. “Stop it!”</p>
  <p>
  	“Get away from me!”
  shouted Valerie. She looked at Theo. “Don't do this!”</p>
  <p>
  	Theo turned his face away from
  Valerie. Bea shook her head frantically. Suddenly, Bea dashed out
  from behind Theo and made straight for Valerie. Bea pushed one of the
  automatons away from Valerie, but the others quickly swarmed to its
  defense. They shoved Bea to the ground.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo rushed to pick her up. He
  snatched her away from the struggle.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Easy, Bea. It's okay,” he
  tried to calm her.</p>
  <p>
  	The army of automatons hoisted
  the three squirming canvas sacks up and began to carry them out of
  the town square.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Cess's voice boomed from the
  speakers.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Citizens!” he said. “We
  have been duped! The villain has admitted to his own mendacity! But
  have no fear. Law and order shall be restored to Mossville! Justice
  shall be done!”</p>

  <div class='break'>
    <img class='break' alt='&sect;' src='bug15.png'></img>
  </div>

  <p >
  	The army of automatons marched
  in formation throughout the city of Mossville and its environs.
  They burst in on the Baron LePeen as he sat on his velvet chaise
  longue eating strawberry shortcake. They plucked him off of his
  cushion and stuffed him into a canvas bag.
  </p>
  <p>

  	A river of automatons ran through the town bearing wriggling sacks
  full of clerks, magistrates, orphans, and pets. Cess had kept an
  exhaustive list over the years of everyone who had ever cheated him,
  insulted him, stepped in his way, or looked at him askance. It was a
  very long list.
  </p>
  <p >
  	A tower of automatons, each
  standing on the shoulders of the next, reached from the ground to the
  Kook Bog gondola. One by one the struggling contents of the canvas
  sacks were hoisted up, dumped onto the bucket, and jettisoned off to
  the waiting mire.</p>
  <p >
  	Digniggleby, Cynthia, and
  Valerie each got their turns on the gondola. They shot out over the
  sprawling periphery of Mossville, over the craggy black ridge and
  down into the soupy bog below.
  </p>
  <p >
  	In Kook Bog, Berke was having
  a busy day. One by one the Dignigglebys splashed down into the mud.
  One by one he fished them out with the 15-Foot Remote Person
  Extractor.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Another one!” he shouted
  into the tin can telephone, as Valerie climbed onto the dock, covered
  head to toe in thick mud.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Valerie
  screamed up at the receding gondola. “You <em>jerk!</em>”</p>
  <p >
  	Baron LePeen splashed down and
  Berke helped him to the dock. As he did his best to wipe himself off,
  the gondola banged in again and a sheep splashed down into the mud.</p>
  <p >
  	“Oh dear,” said Baron
  LePeen.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Berke spoke into the tin can
  phone.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Looks like a sheep,” he
  said.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Suddenly, Valerie leaped
  forward and grabbed the tin can phone from his hand.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Gimme that!” she said.</p>
  <p >
  	“Hey!” said Berke.</p>
  <p >
  	Valerie pulled the phone's
  twine loose from its hook and flung it with all her might at the
  gondola as it pulled away. The can fell onto the gondola and wedged
  itself between the bucket and the bar of the frame. As the gondola
  pulled away the phone's twine pulled free from one hook after another
  over the Kook Bog village, until the line of twine followed the
  gondola straight from the switchboard gazebo in the center of the
  village. The gondola pulled the twine taut as it rose into the
  clouds.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Valerie ran along the
  boardwalks and decks towards the village as fast as her legs would
  carry her, following the twine to its origin at the switchboard
  gazebo.
  </p>

  <div class='break'>
    <img class='break' alt='&sect;' src='bug13.png'></img>
  </div>

  <p>
  	Mr. Cess and Theo stood on the
  balcony near the gondola launch looking out over the center of
  Mossville as the regiments of baby-doll automatons marched through
  the town. The hum of millions of insects was deafening even from this
  height. The automatons advanced mercilessly through the alleys and
  streets. They were small, but in their numbers they were an
  unstoppable force. Terrified townspeople cowered before the advancing
  ranks. The luckiest were thrown roughly out of the way, while others
  were stuffed into canvas bags and hauled away.</p>
  <p >
  	“Extraordinary!” said Mr.
  Cess. “And all thanks to your brilliant creative gifts. Such an
  accomplishment! So many lives touched.”</p>
  <p >
  	Theo nodded. There was no
  denying he felt a measure of satisfaction. He had always been an
  outsider in Mossville. The people of the town had always been hasty
  to point their fingers at him. He watched the automatons collect the
  fat man who had accused Theo of stealing a watch, and it was hard to
  suppress a smile. Who was the ragamuffin now?</p>
  <p >
  	Bea cowered and trembled. She
  no longer clung to Theo's leg. She hung back, near the far end of the
  balcony. Theo went to her. He bent down and spoke kindly.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“You don't need to be
  afraid,” he said. “They're your friends. I made them for you.”</p>
  <p >
  	Bea looked down at the chaotic
  scene below and shook her head.</p>
  <p >
  	“They have to be tough
  sometimes to be accepted is all,” said Theo.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Cess glanced over at Bea with
  a sneer.</p>
  <p >
  	“A little jealous of the
  attention?” he said.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Suddenly, Valerie's voice rang
  out from the gondola platform.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Theo!” she cried.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Theo looked up to see the tin
  can phone wedged in the gondola. Valerie's voice continued.</p>
  <p >
  	“If you can hear me, I just
  want you to know that I thought you were better than this! I thought
  you cared about Bea! But now I know that you just want to have
  control.”</p>
  <p >
  	Theo shook his head and
  crinkled his nose indignantly.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“That's not true,” he
  said, half to Bea and half to himself.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Valerie's
  voice continued. “That's
  why you made all those fakes! Those monsters aren't like Bea and you
  know it! Bea knows it too!”</p>
  <p>
  	Bea trembled violently.</p>
  <p>
  	“Desperate people will say
  anything,” said Cess. He strode toward the gondola launch platform.

  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo gripped Bea by the
  shoulders. “She's wrong!”</p>
  <p>
  	Down in Kook Bog, Valerie
  crouched on the roof of the central communication gazebo, gripping
  the end of the tin can telephone in both hands. She really was
  desperate. She clenched her eyes and wondered what else she could say
  to possibly convince Theo he was making a mistake.</p>
  <p>
  	She felt a tap on her
  shoulder.
  </p>
  <p>
  	She looked up to see Rudy
  Promovendis standing beside her on the roof of the gazebo. He was a
  disheveled, mud-caked mess, but his eyes shone with energy. He smiled
  at Valerie and held out his hand.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Let me talk to him,” said
  Rudy.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Up above, on the balcony, Cess
  had just reached the gondola platform when Rudy's voice came through
  the can.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Theo?” it said.</p>
  <p>
  	Theo's jaw dropped. “Dad?”</p>
  <p>
  	But Cess had heard all he
  wanted to hear. He drew a large Bowie knife from his jacket.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Enough of this!” he said,
  and cut the twine in a single, swift stroke. The tin can clattered on
  the stairwells below and the twine drifted off in the wind.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“As a matter of fact, I've
  had enough of that whole blasted bog!” said Cess. “It was a fine
  place to toss the riffraff when I didn't have other choices. But now
  that we've got some order around here, there's no point doing things
  halfway!”</p>
  <p>
  	Cess strode into his office.</p>
  <p>
  	“What are you doing?” said
  Theo.</p>
  <p>
  	“Kook Bog is more trouble
  than it's worth!” boomed Cess.</p>
  <p>
  	Theo looked out over the
  violence below. A gang of automatons pummeled an old man, another
  group threw a golden retriever into a sack, and still others hoisted
  a schoolteacher onto their shoulders and carried her down an alley.
  The city was engulfed in chaos.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo leaped onto the gondola
  platform in time to see Cess open the control box of the Suction-Flux
  Hydro-Debogilator. Cess grabbed the knob and turned it to the right
  as far as it went, well into the red zone. He pulled off the knob and
  threw it out the doorway.</p>
  <p>
  	“There!” said Cess.</p>
  <p>
  	“Wait!” cried Theo.</p>
  <p>
  	Cess grinned maliciously.</p>
  <p>
  	“Indeed,” he said. “That's
  all that's left to do now, my boy.”</p>
