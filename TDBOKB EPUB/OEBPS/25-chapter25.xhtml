  <h1>A New Morning for Stationery and Soap</h1>

  A stage was set up in the newly-cobbled town square and the townspeople
  thronged around it. The square was festooned with lanterns and
  colored paper ribbons. A banner over the stage read <em>MOSSVILLE
  SALUTES THREE GENERATIONS OF HEROES</em>. On stage, a band of schoolchildren played.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Theo, Rudy, and Pythagoras
  stood on the stage. Theo glowed with pride. Pythagoras wore a slight
  smile——an expression of hard-won peace. Rudy stood between them,
  one hand on each of their shoulders, filled with pride and love for
  his father and his son.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Mayor Felix, deservedly
  elected after a career of dedicated public service as a patent office
  clerk, stood at the microphone.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Ladies and gentleman,”
  said Felix. “Today we celebrate the righting of great wrongs, and
  extend the gratitude of all the hearts of Mossville to three
  generations of brilliant men and selfless heroes. Please join me in
  expressing our profound appreciation to Pythagoras, Rudolph, and
  Theodore Promovendis!”</p>
  <p >
  	The crowd erupted in applause.
  Valerie stood in front of the stage smiling widely. Bea stood next to
  her, holding her hand. Theo reached down from the stage and Valerie
  lifted Bea up and passed her to Theo.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Theo held Bea up for everyone
  to see and the crowd applauded even more jubilantly.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Meriweather
  Digniggleby stood proudly in front of a small shopfront on the
  square. A hand-painted sign in the window read <em>Digniggleby's
  Fine Bath and Office Goods</em>.
  In the window a lovingly arranged display of bath and office-related
  items was laid out: a typewriter mounted on a floatation device,
  fountain pens with scrub-brushes attached, and a wide selection of
  oblong soap paperweights in every color you could imagine. Cynthia
  Digniggleby peered out at the festivities from behind the window.
  </p>
  <p>
  	In
  the hills to the west, near the mud slope that once was Gurwell's
  barley field, Ballhatchet and Dooley stood knee deep in mud as they
  shoveled it into a wheelbarrow. They wore matching coveralls, crusted
  head to toe in dried mud. They watched the fireworks explode in the
  distance.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“You ever miss the old job,
  Dooley?” asked Ballhatchet.</p>
  <p>
  	Dooley thought about it for a
  minute.</p>
  <p>
  	“Not really,” he said.</p>
  <p>
  	Ballhatchet nodded in
  agreement. He scratched his nose.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Y'know, one of these days,
  somebody's gonna make a killing on baby wigs,” he said. 	</p>
  <p>
  	“Yeah,” said Dooley.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Ballhatchet sniffed. Dooley shrugged. The two of them returned to
  digging.
