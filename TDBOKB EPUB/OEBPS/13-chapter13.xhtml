  <p>
  	The
  next morning, Rudy had still not returned. Theo ate what was left of
  a bottle of yogurt and a handful of walnuts. There were enough coins
  in the kitchen money jar that he'd be able to take care of himself
  for a while, but he had no doubt now. Something was wrong.</p>
  <p>
  	Theo tried not to fear the
  worst. If not in the city, his father could be anywhere. Collecting
  the ingredients for his work required him to visit all kinds of wild
  places, and some of them were dangerous. Ferocious animals, poisonous
  insects, and overprotective property owners were common hazards. Theo
  shuddered when he thought of the wild boars of Bastable Wood to the
  northeast of Mossville. They were notoriously protective of their
  truffles. Theo had gotten too close for comfort more than once while
  collecting spores there.
  </p>
  <p>
  	It was out of the question to
  go to the authorities when he himself was on the run. It wouldn't
  help anybody for him to be thrown in jail, even for a short time. In
  any case, Theo didn't have much confidence in the abilities of the
  Mossville police. If they couldn't even catch an eleven-year-old boy
  what use could they possibly be?
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo would have to be his own
  one-man search party. He'd go to the places his father went and he'd
  find him one way or another. Theo only hoped that wherever his father
  was, he would be all right there for a while.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The only question was where to
  look first.
  </p>
  <p>
  	One thing Theo did know was
  that he needed leonore extract. Both Bea and his father's engines
  used a lot of that. The leonore extract attracted the bugs and
  stimulated the aphids to secrete their honeydew, which was the basis
  of the whole system. Theo's supply was almost gone and the only
  reserve in the house had been in the bottle he'd splashed all over
  the workshop.
  </p>
  <p>
  	There wasn't much dangerous
  about the leonore fields. It was hard to imagine his father running
  into trouble just collecting flowers. But it was a place his father
  went frequently, and with the supply low it would have been a likely
  place to go.</p>
  <p>
  	Theo left Bea resting
  peacefully in the secret shelter. The bugs seemed stable, orbiting
  and circulating smoothly. He collected Buford the Toad from the
  windowsill enclosure and headed towards the leonore fields.
  </p>
  <p>
  	It was about a three mile walk
  from the house in the opposite direction of town. Most of the way was
  woods. The sun peeked through the trees. Theo carried Buford in a
  large wooden bucket. The toad clung to the  rim, watching the
  scenery.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The leonore fields were in
  full bloom, a blanket of pink so bright it seemed to glow in the
  sunshine. Theo scanned the rolling fields as far as he could see.
  There was no sign of anyone there.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Bea would be needing the
  leonore extract soon. He set to work picking the blossoms.</p>

  <div class='break'>
    <img class='break' alt='&sect;' src='bug9.png'></img>
  </div>

  <p>
  	Ballhatchet and Dooley peeked
  through the foliage at the peacefully reclining Bea. Ballhatchet held
  a large potato sack.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Here's my idea,”
  whispered Ballhatchet. “I say we lure it out with sausages.”</p>
  <p>
  	“What the heck are you
  talking about?” said Dooley. “That's the stupidest thing I ever
  heard.”</p>
  <p>
  	“I don't know why you always
  think my ideas are stupid,” said Ballhatchet. “Babies love
  sausages.”</p>
  <p>
  	“Where'd you get the idea
  babies love sausages?” said Dooley.</p>
  <p>
  	“Everybody knows that,”
  said Ballhatchet.</p>
  <p>
  	“First of all, Ballhatchet,
  that's a bunch of hooey,” said Dooley. “And it doesn't matter
  anyway because that thing is no baby. It's a doll head for Pete's
  sake. What's it gonna do with a sausage?”</p>
  <p>
  	“Eat it of course,” said
  Ballhatchet.</p>
  <p>
  	“Did you bring sausages?”
  asked Dooley.</p>
  <p>
  	“No,” said Ballhatchet.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Dooley rolled his eyes.</p>
  <p>
  	“Here's what we're gonna
  do,” he said. “We're going to grab it and stick it in the sack.
  Ready?”</p>
  <p>
  	With a crash, Ballhatchet and
  Dooley barged through the branches of the shelter. Bea flailed in
  reaction, her movements awkward and jerky. The insects' flights
  became irregular and clouds of insects spread haphazardly out from
  her joints and belly. The halo of bugs that encircled her head
  shifted into wild, irregular shapes.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Dooley grabbed Bea. Her body
  twitched and kicked violently at his touch. The circulating swarms of
  insects clustered and unclustered spasmodically, loosening into
  shapeless clouds then tightening into knots around Dooley.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I got it!” he yelled.
  “Open up the bag!”</p>
  <p>
  	Ballhatchet fumbled to find
  the mouth of the potato sack. It took him a few seconds to realize he
  was holding it upside down.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Ballhatchet!” hollered
  Dooley.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Ballhatchet struggled to turn
  the potato sack around and hold it open. All at once, a cloud of
  insects exploded from Bea's midsection and her body went limp. A
  thick black cloud of wasps, moths, cicadas and gnats attacked Dooley
  with full force.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Gaah!” cried Dooley,
  dropping Bea and falling to his knees.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Ballhatchet lunged towards
  Bea.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I got it, I got it!” he
  shouted.
  </p>
  <p>
  	A second cloud of bugs split
  off from the first and swarmed over Ballhatchet.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Ow! Ow!” he cried.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The men swung their arms
  wildly, helplessly batting at the thousands of bugs that tormented
  them. Dooley gestured pathetically to retreat. He walked on his knees
  almost blindly, his hands occupied with waving and wiping the bugs.
  Finally he managed to find his feet and he broke into a run.
  Ballhatchet followed. The two of them ran and ran until the clouds of
  insects around them had thinned and disappeared.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Blasted bugs!” said
  Dooley. “Now what are we gonna do?”</p>
  <p>
  	“If we had some sausages——”
  began Ballhatchet.</p>
  <p>
  	“Ballhatchet!” exclaimed
  Dooley. But he had nothing else to say.
  </p>

  <p>
  	It
  was late afternoon when Theo returned with a full bucket of leonore
  blossoms. There had been no trace of his father anywhere near the
  leonore fields. Theo felt dejected and afraid. He put Buford back
  into his enclosure and left the leonore in the workshop for
  processing later. Then he headed up to the shelter.</p>
  <p>
  	 Valerie was already there in
  the shelter with Bea. Bea was dressed in a purple silk dress with
  white lace and gold-threaded trim. For a moment, Theo was too
  surprised by the clothing to put his finger on what else was wrong.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Isn't she beautiful!”
  said Valerie. “She let me dress her! I think she's starting to like
  me. She didn't fuss at all.”</p>
  <p>
  	But Theo just stared. An
  expression of horror fell over his face. Bea was strangely limp. The
  buzzing of the bugs was faint and uneven and the clouds around her
  were much sparser and slower than usual.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“What's this?” he said.
  “What happened here?”</p>
  <p>
  	“We had a deal!” insisted
  Valerie in a hurt voice. “You said I could dress her!”</p>
  <p>
  	“Not that,” said Theo.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo looked around the
  shelter. A section of the shelter had been completely destroyed.
  Branches were broken and leaves littered the ground. There were
  footprints of large shoes and gashes in the dirt floor of the
  shelter. Something violent had happened here.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo reached down and picked
  up a few small mechanical parts that had been knocked off Bea in the
  scuffle.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Valerie too now saw what Theo
  was talking about. She chastised herself silently for not having
  noticed sooner. Theo saw confusion and fear in her eyes.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“When did you get here?”
  asked Theo.</p>
  <p>
  	“Just a little while ago,”
  said Valerie. “I just wanted to put the dress on and surprise you.”</p>
  <p>
  	“How is she?” asked Theo.</p>
  <p>
  	They both looked at Bea.</p>
  <p>
  	“I don't know,” said
  Valerie. Her voice was almost a whisper. “I just thought she was
  sleepy.”</p>
  <p>
  	Theo crouched down. From his
  bag he took a palette of powders and gels and began to apply them to
  Bea. Gradually, the buzzing became more even and the bugs flew more
  smoothly. Bea turned her head back and forth groggily. Her body
  trembled.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“She needs more bugs,”
  said Theo. “Especially aphids. We need to take her out a bit. I
  think she can collect them without my having to draw a swarm if we
  give her some time.”</p>
  <p>
  	“What if someone sees her?”
  asked Valerie. “What if they come after her again?”</p>
  <p>
  	“We'll have to be careful,”
  said Theo. “I think I know a place.”</p>
  <p>
  	Theo lifted Bea and led them
  through the woods towards the southern tip of Gurwell's field. They
  came to a patch of wild grass set into the hillside concealed by
  trees and rocks. 	</p>
  <p>
  	Theo set Bea down and dabbed
  her lightly with the remnants of the leonore extract from his pack.
  With a dropper, he applied a yellowish fluid to the clockwork
  switches of her head. A drop of the fluid ran down the side of Bea's
  face. Valerie took a handkerchief from her purse and reached forward
  to wipe it off. Bea turned her head away from the handkerchief in
  annoyance.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I brought some sandwiches,”
  said Valerie. “Want one?”</p>
  <p>
  	She handed Theo a roll filled
  with meat and alfalfa sprouts.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Little by little, bugs came
  from the woods, the field, and the valley below. They circled Bea in
  a sparse cloud. Bea's trembling began to subside.</p>
  <p>
  	Valerie held out her fingers
  for Bea to grab. Bea's shaky fingers closed around Valerie's. Bea
  crouched on her haunches and pushed as Valerie tried to help her to
  her feet.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“She's trying,” said
  Valerie.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo spooned several tiny
  spoonfuls of flax-colored powder onto platforms extending from Bea's
  knees. A flurry of gnats from the surrounding cloud clustered around
  Bea's knees and joined the ever more rapidly circulating streams of
  her legs.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Suddenly, Bea's grip on
  Valerie's fingers tightened and, in a fluid motion, Bea straightened
  her legs and stood. Valerie coaxed her as Theo watched, intrigued by
  Valerie's rapid progress with Bea.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Bea took a step.</p>
  <p>
  	“You hold one hand,” said
  Valerie to Theo. She held Bea's right hand and Theo took the left.
  </p>
  <p>
  	With Valerie and Theo on
  either side, Bea took a few more steps, tentative at first, then
  increasingly confident. The three of them walked halfway across the
  grassy patch like this, one slow step after another.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Bea stood still. She swayed
  slightly back and forth. Theo and Valerie looked at each other. Bea
  seemed to be balanced. Slowly, they let go of her hands.
  </p>
  <p>
  	She stood by herself for a few
  seconds, then toppled backwards but stopped midair. She hovered in at
  an angle, seeming to defy gravity as the bugs held her body up and
  eventually righted it. Then she took a step on her own.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Preoccupied though he was
  about his father, Theo could scarcely contain his excitement at
  seeing Bea walk. He did not realize how widely he was smiling until
  his eyes met Valerie's.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“She's getting pretty good,
  isn't she!” said Valerie.
  </p>
  <p>
  	They played with Bea as the
  sun went down. She improved rapidly and soon she was able to run from
  one of them to the other. She stumbled often, but most times the bugs
  caught her before she landed. The other times she tumbled face first
  into the soft grass, but rose up undeterred and continued to play.
  </p>
  <p>
  	By the time the sun had set,
  she could do most of what a small child could do and a few other
  things as well. She could jump up and hover in the air as high as
  Theo's shoulders, supported by the bugs. Theo watched her
  increasingly graceful movements. At moments he felt he could hardly
  believe it had been he himself who created her.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The three of them were all
  tired and in relatively good spirits as they walked up the path
  towards the secret shelter. From time to time Bea stopped to pick up
  rocks and leaves.
  </p>
  <p>
  	It was Bea who stopped at the
  mailbox.</p>
  <p>
  	“What's she doing?” asked
  Theo.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Valerie shrugged. “She's
  just distracted.”</p>
  <p>
  	Bea crouched down and picked
  up something white. She held it up proudly and ran happily towards
  Valerie.</p>
  <p>
  	“What do you have?” said
  Valerie.
  </p>
  <p>
  	It was a torn white envelope.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“That's just garbage,”
  said Valerie. “Give it to me.”</p>
  <p>
  	Theo stepped closer to look.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Let me see that,” he
  said.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Written across the front of
  the envelope was his father's name. The return address was stamped
  <em>MOSSVILLE MUNICIPAL
  OFFICE OF PATENT REGISTRATION AND PROCESSING</em>.</p>
  <p>
  	Theo tried to think of what it
  could mean. His father's disappearance, the demonstration in the town
  square, and now this. He could make no sense of it. But he certainly
  knew where he had to look next.</p>
  <p>
  	“I need you to take care of
  her tomorrow,” he said.</p>
  <p>
  	“Why? Where will you be?”
  asked Valerie.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I have to find my dad,”
  said Theo.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Valerie gestured at Theo's
  bag.</p>
  <p>
  	“But I don't know anything
  about all that stuff,” she said.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“You have to learn,” said
  Theo. “I can teach you.”</p>
  <p>
  	Valerie looked uneasily at
  Bea.</p>
  <p>
  	“She's half yours, you
  know,” said Theo.</p>
