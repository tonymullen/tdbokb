	<p>
		Young Rudy Promovendis was fourteen years old when his world, quite
	literally, collapsed.
	</p>
	<p>
		It came as a surprise to him,
	but the signs had been there all along. The mud had been rising
	throughout Mossville for months, if not years, and the periodic
	rumbles of the shifting earth had become all too familiar to the
	town's residents. From time to time, Rudy heard the hushed talk among
	adults of a coming catastrophe. There had been damage done already.
	Mud-related mishaps had even claimed a few lives, but the incidents
	had been isolated. The worst, it was feared, was yet to come.</p>
	<p>
	 	Rudy's father had certainly
	sensed the danger. Pythagorus Promovendis had been more preoccupied
	by the encroaching mud than anybody else. Rudy often saw a strange,
	mad fire leap in the older man's eyes when the soft ground groaned
	beneath their feet. But for Rudy, the reality of the threat had not
	sunk in.</p>
	<p>
		On the fateful morning,
	safety-conscious budding scientist that he was, Rudy had opened his
	window in preparation for an experiment involving Pyrolusite powder,
	spirits of salt, and the production of an exceedingly hazardous gas.
	He pushed the window up as high as it went and drew the curtains back
	to let as much fresh air as he could. As inquisitive as he was, Rudy
	had no wish to extinguish himself in the name of science.
	</p>
	<p>
		Below the window, through the
	orange and yellow autumn leaves still clinging to their branches, his
	father's work shed stood quietly, embedded in the soft mud of the
	hillside. Rudy's gaze lingered on the work shed. Once upon a time,
	his father had welcomed his help, but as Rudy got older, his father
	had become cagey and distant. Rudy had not seen the inside of the
	work shed since he was seven or eight years old. The rejection stung.
	He knew his father was working on something extraordinary.
	</p>
	<p>
		“The less you know about my
	work these days the better,” his father had told him. “The time
	will come. Wait.”</p>
	<p>
		But Rudy found it impossible
	not to wonder. His father's occasional, tantalizing outbursts made
	his curiosity burn all the more hotly.
	</p>
	<p>
		“When I finish my work, all
	of this will be behind us,” Pythagorus mumbled from time to time
	over yet another supper of thin porridge and offal. “This family's
	troubles will be over, along with all of Mossville's.”
	</p>
	<p>
		But when Rudy pressed him for
	more on the nature of the windfall, his father became gruff and
	evasive.
	</p>
	<p>
		“In due time, boy,” he
	said. But the time had never come.
	</p>
	<p>Rudy
	returned to his experiment. An ancient leather-bound tome lay on his
	desk, tied around the middle with a bone-white ribbon. <em>Principia
	Chemica </em>was
	printed in faded gold leaf across the cover. Rudy untied the ribbon
	and gently opened the book.
	</p>
	<p>
		A stiff wire stand held a test
	tube a few feet above the surface of his desk. Rudy spooned the black
	powder into the test tube and poured the clear liquid after it. He
	struck a match and lit the wick of a small alcohol burner. A low
	flame began to glow.
	</p>
	<p>
		A curl of greenish-yellow gas
	began to rise from the test tube. Rudy sat back pulled his shirt in
	front of his face instinctively as the faint whiff of the
	gas—somewhere between pepper and pineapple—reached his nose.
	</p>
	<p>
		“Rudolph!” his mother's
	voice came up through the floorboards.</p>
	<p>
		Rudy blew out the flame and
	scurried to the head of the stairs.
	</p>
	<p>
		“Yes, Mother!” he called.
	</p>
	<p>
		“Wood!” said his mother.</p>
	<p>
		“Yes, Mother!”</p>
	<p>
		Quickly, Rudy put on his boots
	and jacket and went out to the woodpile behind the house. He took the
	ax from its place against the pile and split three logs, as much as
	he could carry.
	</p>
	<p>
		As he gathered the woods in
	his arms, he heard a faint buzzing sound. He looked around.</p>
	<p>
		A loose cloud of aphids had
	begun to take shape amid the trees behind the house. Rudy watched as
	the cloud thickened and grew. Slowly, the aphids began to rise.
	Rudy's gaze followed the pulsating swarm of aphids upward.</p>
	<p>
		With a start, Rudy realized
	that other insects had also begun to swarm and rise. Throughout the
	woods, columns of flies and gnats emerged in ragged vertical streaks.
	As he watched, the streaks moved together, consolidating into a dark
	column which extended straight into the sky.
	</p>
	<p>
		Rudy clutched the bundle of
	wood and ran into the house.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the kitchen, Rudy's mother
	was fiddling with the door of the stove. She was a large woman with
	thick, strong hands. The latch of the door flopped uselessly in her
	fingers and the door swung freely on its hinge.
	</p>
	<p>
		“Where is your father? He
	said he'd fix this when he came home from town, but that was hours
	ago!”</p>
	<p>
		Piece by piece, she took the
	wood from Rudy's arms and tossed it into the belly of the stove.
	</p>
	<p>
		“He must have come home and
	gone straight to that work shed of his,” she said. “He has no
	sense of time in there.”</p>
	<p>
		“The bugs are acting
	strangely again, Mother,” said Rudy.
	</p>
	<p>
		His mother paused, knitting
	her brows.
	</p>
	<p>
		“Go on up to your room,”
	she said. “I'll call you when your broth is hot.”</p>
	<p>
		“Mother,” he said. “What
	do you suppose Father is building?”</p>
	<p>
		Rudy's mother sighed.</p>
	<p>
		“I don't know, Rudolph,”
	she said. “But for all his quirks, your father is a brilliant man.
	If he says his work is important, I believe that it is. I'm sure he
	has his reasons for his secrecy.”
	</p>
	<p>
		Rudy shrugged, unsatisfied
	with the answer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Rudy returned to his room and
	sat quietly for a time. He found a scarf in the bottom of his chest
	of clothing and wrapped it around his face before returning to his
	experiment. Once again, he positioned the burner underneath the test
	tube and lit the wick. Once again, the greenish gas began to snake
	upward.</p>
	<p>
		Rudy felt a tremor pass
	through him. It was so subtle that for a moment he thought he had
	simply shivered, although he did not feel cold. Rudy paused. For a
	second or two, all was still. Then another tremor. The burner on the
	table rattled, then went silent for two or three more seconds.</p>
	<p>
		That was all the warning there
	was.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before Rudy could even stand,
	the floor beneath him lurched sickeningly. His stomach rose as his
	body dropped and the floor bumped to a halt, hurling him off of his
	chair, then shifted and began to creak in the opposite direction,
	like a ship on a stormy sea.
	</p>
	<p>
		The contents of Rudy's desk,
	burner, test tube, books, and all spilled onto the floor with a
	crash. Rudy gasped as he watched the poisonous green puff rise from
	the shattered test tube. The burner, too, had smashed. In an instant,
	a low flame flashed across the floor, where the alcohol from the
	burner was spreading slowly.</p>
	<p>
		Rudy leaped to
	his feet. He grabbed the tattered woolen blanket from his bed and
	began to beat the burning alcohol. The blue flames danced and licked
	the blanket. He held his breath and squinted his eyes against the
	spreading haze of chlorine that was filling his room. From below he
	heard his mother's shout.</p>
	<p>
		“Goodness! The stove!” 	</p>
	<p>
		The flames began to subside
	under Rudy's beating. He threw the blanket over the remaining alcohol
	and stomped it out completely with his feet. The green gas, too, was
	thinning in the wind from the open window. The room's movement slowed
	and eventually shuddered to a halt with the floor still at a
	sickening angle.</p>
	<p>
		Rudy's relief was short-lived.
	The room was uncomfortably hot. And when dared to gasp for air
	through his tightly wadded shirt, the acrid smell of smoke filled his
	nostrils. Only moments before, the wisps of smoke from below had been
	barely noticeable. Now thick gray tendrils seeped through the cracks
	between the floorboards and under his door. Rudy realized sickly that
	the real fire had been beneath him the whole time.</p>
	<p>
		Rudy dashed to the door of his
	bedroom, but the  doorknob burned his fingers and he pulled away.
	Beyond his bedroom the crackling of the flames and the creaking of
	burning wood told him that the blaze was advancing rapidly through
	the house. Smoke now billowed into his room from all directions.</p>
	<p>
		There was only one way for him
	out of the room. It was not an easy jump, but for a boy of his age
	and aptitude, it was not impossible. He sprinted across the floor of
	his bedroom, through the smoke and lingering green gas, and dove
	headlong out the window into the branches of the maple outside.
	</p>
	<p>
		As the branches bent beneath
	him, Rudy looked back at the room he'd just escaped. At that moment
	his mother, panting and soot-blackened, burst into the bedroom door
	at the far side of his room, followed by a billow of flame.
	</p>
	<p>
		“Mother!” he screamed, as
	the branches gave way, rolling him onto the soft ground below with a
	belching splat. The mud at the base of the house was nearly up to his
	knees.
	</p>
	<p>
		Rudy struggled to stand. The
	house was an inferno. He looked up desperately at his own bedroom
	window, but his mother did not appear.</p>
	<p>
		He spun around and began down
	the slope towards his father's work shed. The hill had become a
	nearly solid mudslide. Trees and bushes seemed to crawl alongside him
	like slugs as he splashed and slid into the deepening muck.
	</p>
	<p>
		“Father!” he cried.
	“Father! Help!”</p>
	<p>
		But as he approached the place
	where the work shed should have been, he felt first confusion and
	then raw horror. When he finally spotted the corner of the work
	shed's roof poking up from the soupy mud, his heart stopped.</p>
	<p>
		“FATHER!” he screamed.
	</p>
	<p>
		He stood waist deep in the
	oozing river of mud. Above him the fire roared, consuming his home
	and all he had ever known. Below him the remnants of his father's
	precious work shed disappeared into the brown deluge.</p>
	<p>
		“Father!” his voice was
	now only a rasp.
	</p>
	<p>
		It had all happened so
	suddenly that his emotions could scarcely catch up to the horrific
	events. His head spun. His parents were gone. His home was gone.
	Everything was gone.
	</p>
	<p>
		The mud of Mossville had
	claimed its latest victims.
	</p>
