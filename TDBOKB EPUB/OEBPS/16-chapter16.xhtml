  <p>
  	Theo
  soared through the air at breakneck speed, his bottom wedged tightly
  into the bucket seat of the Kook Bog gondola. He strained to look
  back over his shoulder.</p>
  <p>
  	“Bea! Wait!” he hollered.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The gondola flew over the
  patchwork of fields beyond the eastern edge of Mossville. It dipped
  and then rose again to clank past the next pole, then sailed over the
  black, craggy ridge and dropped sickeningly into the mist of the
  chasm beyond. Wind and moisture buffeted Theo's face.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The gondola broke through the
  clouds and for a few brief moments Theo could see the gas lights and
  low wooden buildings of a village. His eyes widened in panic as the
  gondola rushed straight towards the dark ground.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Fifteen feet short of hitting
  the ground the gondola slammed to a sickening halt, launching Theo
  headlong into the soft mud below. He smacked down with a belching
  splat.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo struggled to find his
  feet but the mud was deeper than he was tall. He managed to squirm
  around to get a look at the gondola hanging above him. He grabbed at
  it, but it was far out of his reach.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The gondola emitted a few
  clicks, jerked abruptly,  then began to shake violently from side to
  side with a loud chugging sound. It slowly withdrew back up into the
  clouds, shaking continuously.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Bea!” cried Theo, but
  there were more pressing things to worry about. He was sinking. He
  flailed frantically. “Help!”
  </p>
  <p>
  	The end of a long stick struck
  the surface of the mud beside his head. A man's voice called to him.</p>
  <p>
  	“Grab it!”
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo grabbed the stick and
  held on tightly as he was pulled toward a wooden dock amid the sea of
  mud. A large, slow-moving man in worn overalls reached down and
  offered a meaty hand. Theo took it gratefully and scrambled onto the
  dock.
  </p>
  <p>
  	When Theo had caught his
  breath, he looked around. He was in the middle of a huge, thickly
  wooded swamp. Moss-covered trees and vines rose from thick mud which
  undulated slowly and lichen-crusted rocks poked out of the bog. Theo
  looked at the spot where he'd landed. His outline was still imprinted
  in the bubbling, swirling green scum that coated the surface.
  Overhead the clouds were so low he felt he could reach out and touch
  them. The smell of peat smoke filled the air.
  </p>
  <p>
  	A wooden walkway ran from the
  dock. About twenty-five yards away it intersected with a collection
  of other walkways, all supported by wood pilings driven into the
  burbling mud. In the distance through the trees yellow lights
  flickered.
  </p>
  <p>
  	An arrangement of tall poles
  dotted the swamp as far as Theo could see. Each pole was separated by
  a few yards in each direction from neighboring poles. The poles
  supported a labyrinthine network of twine that looked like an
  entanglement of spiderwebs over the village. The numerous lengths of
  twine terminated at wooden racks from which dangled rows of tin cans.
  One of these racks was set up at the dock where Theo stood now. The
  man in overalls picked up one of the tin cans and spoke into it.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Arrival,” he said. “Male,
  about twelve years old. Four and a half feet or so. Looks like he'll
  have an appetite.”</p>
  <p>
  	The man put down the tin can
  and turned to Theo.</p>
  <p>
  	“Pretty nice isn't it,”
  said the man.</p>
  <p>
  	“What?” said Theo.</p>
  <p>
  	The man held up his stick.</p>
  <p>
  	“The <em>15-foot
  mid-precision remote person extractor</em>,”
  he said proudly. “My baby. Reliable too! Second time this week
  without a hitch.”</p>
  <p>
  	“The stick?” said Theo.</p>
  <p>
  	“I think of it as a helpful,
  lifestyle-enhancing innovation,” said the man. “And job security!
  I'm set for life as welcoming committee with this baby.”</p>
  <p>
  	“Welcoming committee?”
  repeated Theo bemusedly.</p>
  <p>
  	“That's me. The name's
  Berke. Welcome to Kook Bog.”</p>
  <p>
  	Theo blinked. “People live
  here?”</p>
  <p>
  	Berke gestured in the
  direction of the lights.</p>
  <p>
  	“People that way. Follow the
  wide boardwalk straight on in,” he said. “The first narrow fork
  off to the right goes to the bug fields. Not that you'd want to go
  there though. Certainly not without packing a lunch. The first fork
  left leads to the mushroom farm. You'll want to just keep left for
  that. The second walkway on the right leads to——”</p>
  <p>
  	“I don't need a tour,”
  said Theo. “Just tell me how to get back.”	</p>
  <p>
  	Berke looked at Theo blankly,
  then glanced up at the gondola cables overhead. He furrowed his brow.</p>
  <p>
  	“People don't really go
  back,” he said.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo opened his mouth to
  protest, but he had no idea what to say. A loud croak came from the
  mud behind him. Berke pricked up his ears and craned his neck to see
  where the sound had come from.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Buford sat on a lily pad a few
  feet away from the dock. He jumped into Theo's hands.</p>
  <p>
  	“That yours?” said Berke.</p>
  <p>
  	Theo nodded.</p>
  <p>
  	“That's a nice looking
  toad,” said Berke.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Something in Berke's tone made
  Theo uneasy. He wasn't sure how to respond to the compliment. In any
  case, it was clear Berke wasn't the person to help him get out of the
  bog.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo followed the walkway
  toward the populated center of Kook Bog. The village was like nothing
  he had ever seen. It was crisscrossed with elevated boardwalks that
  snaked over and under each other. Some of the walkways terminated at
  buildings, some led to other walkways or decks, and still others led
  to conical gazebos which acted as hubs for the network of twine
  overhead.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The buildings were made of
  wood and built upon stilts and platforms to hold them above the
  bubbling mud. Over time they had sunk and settled at odd angles.
  Curls of smoke rose from lopsided chimneys; some jutted out straight
  from the sides of houses, others extended crookedly upward.
  Everything looked as though it had been built by quarrelsome
  committees of mad visionaries. Doorknobs and window shutters were
  rigged with elaborate pulley and gear systems. Doors half sunken into
  the bog opened by unusual mechanisms: some swiveled, some slid, some
  folded like accordions, and some seemed to telescope into themselves.

  </p>
  <p>
  	The people had devised their
  own ways to get around. Most of them stayed to the boardwalks, but
  some used contraptions to move more freely. Several villagers waded
  through the mire on mechanical stilts. Another man walked across
  wearing pontoon shoes. Still another had harnessed himself into an
  elaborate rig of bungee cords and carabiners which flung him through
  the air from one walkway to another. A white-haired old woman flapped
  loudly overhead in a pedal-driven flying device that looked like a
  huge leather duck.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The tin-can telephone lines
  were everywhere. People clustered near the phone racks and chatted
  into the cans. The strands of twine were pulled taut on hooks
  throughout the town and met at the tips of the gazebo hubs. From each
  of the gazebo hubs the collected bundles of twine extended further to
  a much larger and more ornate gazebo that towered over the center of
  Kook Bog. This central communication gazebo bustled with activity
  inside. A large cylindrical switchboard stood in its center and
  operators sat in a circle manning the switches.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Far overhead, through a part
  in the clouds, Theo could see the black arc of the Suction-Flux
  Hydro-Debogilator extending silently across the sky.
  </p>
  <p>
  	A wild-eyed, bearded man
  walked past Theo with a strap around his forehead from which a dozen
  rear-view mirrors extended at odd angles. Another man was had a pair
  of hydraulic telescoping stilts mounted on his belt. When he walked
  straight they looked like a pair of gun holsters, but when he
  approached a corner they extended themselves, lifted him up, turned
  his body in the correct new direction to walk, and put him down. A
  woman passed by with a set of head-mounted binaural megaphones. A
  destitute hobo lay against the side of a building. On his head a
  swiveling drinky-bird toy and a glass of water were attached to a
  gyroscope. When the bird tipped its beak into the into the water it
  opened a dropper and created a siphon effect that sucked whiskey out
  of a flask, through a coil of tubes, and into the hobo's mouth.
  </p>
  <p>
  	People were gathering on a
  broad deck not far from the central communication gazebo. A man's
  voice came through a megaphone.</p>
  <p>
  	“Come one, come all! Witness
  the impossible!”
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo squeezed through the
  crowd for a look.
  </p>
  <p>
  	A colorful, hand-painted
  placard was displayed on an easel. The placard read:</p>

  <div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; font-size: 1.5em">
<p><br/></p>
  <em>Astonishing
  Amphibian Extravaganza</em>
<p><br/></p>
  <em>Brigadier
  Weissbottom's</em>

<p><br/></p>
  <em>TOAD CIRCUS</em>

</div>
  <p><br/></p>

  <p>
  	Beside
  the easel a broad, angled platform was set out with a complete
  miniature three ring circus including two  trapezes, a high-wire, a
  unicycle, and an assortment of other props. To one side stood a
  peculiar agglomeration of musical instruments to which were attached
  an assortment of levers, see-saws, and bellows. In front of the
  platform a broad wooden vat of water was displayed. A miniature
  diving board extended out over the vat.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Next to the platform, the
  diminutive ringmaster——who Theo surmised to be the Brigadier
  Weissbottom of the placard——hawked the upcoming performance
  through the megaphone.</p>
  <p>
  	“Attend in amazement the astonishing
  amphibian extravaganza!” called Brigadier Weissbottom. “See for yourself
  the surprising salientian spectacular! The most astounding show in Kook Bog!”</p>
  <p>
  	Brigadier Weissbottom's face
  was puffy and red. He sported an ample white mustache that had been
  painstakingly waxed and curled at the tips. His right eye was covered
  by a large black eye patch.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Fittingly for a circus
  ringmaster, he wore black top hat and a bright red and yellow
  high-collared, double breasted jacket with tails and epaulets, amply
  dotted with large gold buttons. His trousers were a cacophony of
  multi-colored patches tucked into scuffed black riding boots that
  extended most of the way up his short legs.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The crowd had gathered around
  the platform expectantly. Buford peered out from Theo's shirt pocket.</p>
  <p>
  	“Move in close! Let the
  short ones up front!” called Brigadier Weissbottom, who himself was
  shorter than anyone present, including Theo.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Brigadier Weissbottom produced
  what looked like a large bird cage, draped with a bright red and
  yellow silk cloth. He opened the front of the cloth like curtains and
  unlatched the door of the cage.
  </p>
  <p>
  	A row of toads hopped out of
  the cage and onto the platform. They appeared to be altogether
  ordinary toads. They varied slightly in size and color——some were
  brownish green, others greenish brown——but any of them could have
  passed for Buford in a pinch.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The toads sat in a row facing
  the audience and awaited their cue.</p>
  <p>
  	“Ladies and Gentlemen, I
  give you the astonishing Toad Circus!”</p>
  <p>
  	At that, the toads began their
  performance. Seven of them hopped into place on the musical
  contraption; one jumped up and down on a bellows attached to the
  mouth of the trumpet; one perched upon the valves of the trumpet and
  played out the melody; two others teamed up on the tuba; the fifth
  crawled nimbly over the keys of the organ; the last two rode a
  see-saw that controlled a base drum kicker, a snare drum tap and a
  cymbal crash. They struck up a lively and remarkably
  tightly-performed waltz.
  </p>
  <p>
  	As the music played, the other
  toads sprang into action. They walked on their hind legs. They
  balanced on balls. Two of them leaped onto flying trapezes and
  performed a death defying routine of flips, catches, and mid-air
  somersaults. Others did stunts on the trampoline. One rode the
  miniature unicycle. Still another walked upright across the
  tightrope, gripping a length of wire coat hanger for balance.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I didn't know toads could
  do all that,” he said. He glanced down at Buford and hastily added,
  “No offense.”	</p>
  <p>
  	Buford also seemed duly
  impressed. He strained forward in Theo's pocket, his big eyes wide.</p>
  <p>
  	The crowd clapped and cheered
  the toads as they bounced, flipped, and flew through the air.
  Brigadier Weissbottom moved around the circle with his hat out
  collecting wooden coins, acorns, gears, and whatever other baubles and
  doohickeys the audience members happened to use as their currency. He kept a
  watchful eye on his toads at all times.
  </p>
  <p>
  	For the finale, an ensemble of
  toads dove one by one into the great vat and performed a synchronized
  swimming routine, while another group croaked a four part harmony of
  <em>When The Saints Go
  Marching In</em>
  to the accompaniment of
  the toads on the musical instrument. A third group bounced so high
  above the trampoline that they kept slipping out of view in the low
  clouds.
  </p>
  <p>
  	When the show was finished the
  toads all bowed deeply and Brigadier Weissbottom quickly ushered them
  back into their cage. The crowd began to disperse.
  </p>
  <p>
  	A crooked semicircle of houses and shops lined the deck. A sign hung
  in front of one that read <em>Kook
  Bog Inn</em>.
  A matronly woman stood in the doorway, watching the crowd. She nodded to Theo.</p>
  <p>
  	“You must be the new
  arrival,” she said. “How about some dinner?”</p>
  <p>
  	In the excitement, Theo had
  almost forgotten how hungry he was. Buford's tongue flicked out and
  snapped up a fly, as if he too had just remembered his hunger.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The inn was crowded, full of
  smoke and chatter. Theo sat at the counter as the woman prepared him
  a meal. Beside him a man and a woman carried on a conversation
  through a system of flexible tubes that ran from each of their mouths
  directly to the other person's ears. Their conversation was inaudible
  outside the device but they laughed and chatted comfortably. In a
  corner near Theo, an old man played solitaire. He wore a
  strange contraption of pumps and bellows on his head. A jointed arm
  extended from the apparatus, at the end of which was a metal clip which
  held a cigar a few inches in front of the man's face. Periodically
  the device pumped a burst of smoke into his face.</p>
  <p>
  	The woman introduced herself
  as Dorothy. This was her inn, she explained, and had been for more
  years than she could remember.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo tucked into his meal of
  sausages, mushrooms and boiled potatoes. The meal was wonderful. The
  mushrooms were the most flavorful he'd ever eaten and the potatoes
  were fresh and perfectly prepared. He couldn't quite place the taste
  of the sausages. They were clearly not beef or pork. Theo thought
  perhaps they were made with chicken or duck. In any case, they were
  delicious.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“It's wonderful to see a boy
  with a healthy appetite!” said Dorothy. “You'll need it around
  here. There's a lot of work to be done!”</p>
  <p>
  	“Work?” said Theo.</p>
  <p>
  	Dorothy shrugged genially.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Well, naturally, you'll
  need to earn your keep,” she said with a warm smile. She noticed
  the dark pink-stained rag wrapped around Theo's wrist. “Oh dear,
  you're not hurt are you?”</p>
  <p>
  	“I'm fine,” said Theo.
  “But I'm not staying. I have to get back to Mossville.”</p>
  <p>
  	At those words, the inn seemed
  to go quiet. Dorothy pursed her lips and raised her eyebrows. Theo
  felt the glances of the other customers. He looked around nervously.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“What? What'd I say?” said
  Theo.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Other customers averted their
  eyes and mumbled. Eventually the man in the corner with the cigar
  apparatus spoke up.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“You're not going back to
  Mossville,” said the man.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Yes I am,” said Theo.</p>
  <p>
  	“Makes no difference to me,”
  said the man. “I'm just being neighborly. The sooner you rid
  yourself of that idea the sooner you'll settle in here.”</p>
  <p>
  	“I'm not settling in,”
  said Theo. “I have to go back.”</p>
  <p>
  	The man leaned forward. “And
  what makes you think Mossville wants you back? There's a reason why
  we're all here, you know, and it's not just the mud and the
  mountains. You can't go where you're not needed. It's not like the
  rest of us didn't try.” The man lowered his eyes. “Lord knows I
  thought the world would beat a path to my door for a hands-free cigar
  smoker.”</p>
  <p>
  	“Well, I'm needed there,”
  said Theo.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The man looked straight into
  Theo's eyes.</p>
  <p>
  	“Oh? Then what are you doing
  here?”</p>
  <p>
  	“What Harry is trying to say
  is that it's important to have something to offer,” said Dorothy.
  “Something you can be appreciated for. That's why we're all here
  and not there.”</p>
  <p>
  	“What I was trying to say
  was what I said,” said Harry. “But that's another way to put it I
  suppose.”</p>
  <p>
  	Other customers throughout the
  pub nodded and murmured in agreement. Theo scoffed.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“You
  people sound like my dad,” he said. “All he ever wanted was to be
  useful. But he never knew who he wanted to be useful <em>to</em>.
  I don't care about making myself useful to everybody.”</p>
  <p>
  	“Maybe you ought to listen
  to your dad,” said the cigar man.
  </p>
  <p>
  	At
  that, Theo suddenly felt the weight of all that had happened in the
  last few days. Where <em>was</em>
  his dad? What were they doing to Bea? How would he ever get out of
  this miserable mud pit? Theo felt for a moment that if he spoke again
  he would burst into tears, so he said nothing. He blinked a few times
  and went back to eating his meal.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“You can stay here tonight,”
  said Dorothy. “Don't worry about earning your keep at this point.
  It's hard to be new. It's not so bad once you get used to it.”</p>
  <p>
  	Theo just nodded. He was far
  too tired to argue. There was no point mentioning he had no intention
  of getting used to anything here.</p>
  <p>
  	The bedroom was simple and a
  little bit dingy, but the bed was cozy and piled high with blankets
  and quilts. In the middle of the ceiling a bare light bulb hung on a
  cord. At its base was a miniature generator connected to a small
  water-wheel driven by droplets of water from a crack in the ceiling.
  The room brightened and dimmed with each drip. Theo turned off the
  light and soon fell fast asleep.
  </p>
  <p>
  	He wasn't sure how long he had
  slept when he was awoken by the feeling of something small and damp
  slapping on his face. He opened his eyes to see the figure of Buford
  the Toad just inches away from his nose. He sat up abruptly. Buford
  hopped to the floor into a wedge of orange light from a street lamp
  outside.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“What are you doing?” Theo
  whispered, annoyed.</p>
  <p>
  	Buford hopped to the window
  and onto the sill.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Get down from there,”
  said Theo. “You're going to fall out the window.”</p>
  <p>
  	An agonized croak split the
  night air. Theo squinted at Buford, but the toad had not moved.
  Another croak came from the direction of the window. It wasn't
  Buford.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo crawled out of bed and
  went to the window. He looked down at walkway behind the inn. A door
  was open below and the smell of cooking food wafted up. In the
  doorway Dorothy stood haggling with a diminutive figure on the
  walkway. Even without his ringmaster get-up, Theo recognized
  Brigadier Weissbottom immediately.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“This one here is hard to
  part with,” he said. “Used to be able to do three somersaults and
  a twist on the trampoline. Too fat to perform now though. Still,
  there's a lot on those legs.”</p>
  <p>
  	Theo gasped. Brigadier
  Weissbottom held a large toad up to the light by its feet. Dorothy
  took the toad, looked it over, and dropped it into a basket. The
  basket was already nearly full of other toads. On the walkway beside
  the Brigadier, Theo could make out the silhouette of a large cage
  filled with toads. Light glinted off of tiny chains and shackles
  around their feet.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Dorothy counted out a handful
  of wooden coins and handed them to Brigadier Weissbottom.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“There you go,” she said.
  “And of course your place is always set.”</p>
  <p>
  	“I surely am fond of your
  sausages, ma'am,” said Brigadier Weissbottom. “I could happily
  eat them every day.”</p>
  <p>
  	Dorothy
  laughed. “You <em>do</em>
  eat them every day!”</p>
  <p>
  	Theo pulled back from the
  window, shocked.
  </p>
  <p>
  	He
  thought about the sausages he had eaten for dinner. <em>Toad
  meat?</em>
  It made a certain amount of sense, thought Theo with dismay. Even if
  you could get a cow onto that gondola, Kook Bog was no place for
  livestock. It was no surprise that options for meat were limited.
  Still, toad didn't seem right.</p>
  <p>
  	Not that those sausages hadn't
  been tasty. Theo tried to put them out of his mind.</p>
  <p>
  	“You better keep your head
  down around here,” Theo said to Buford.</p>
  <p>
  	Brigadier Weissbottom's
  footsteps faded along the walkway from the inn.</p>
