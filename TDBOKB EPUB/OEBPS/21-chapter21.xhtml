  <p>
  	After
  a hearty meal of potatoes, cabbage, and mushrooms, Theo sat in the
  loop of rope dangling below the gondola, his feet submerged in the
  mud.</p>
  <p>
  	“I haven't really done this
  before,” said Berke. “I assume it's set not to shake so much on
  the way up this time, but you probably want to hold tight just in
  case.”
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo held tight to the rope
  and Berke pulled a lever on the dock. With a jolt, the gondola began
  to rise smoothly.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The crowd of villagers watched
  Theo go.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Suddenly, Buford the Toad——for
  reasons apparent only within his own amphibian cerebrum——leaped
  out of Theo's shirt pocket and onto the deck.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Buford!” cried Theo,
  swinging his arms vainly to try to catch the toad and just barely
  keeping his balance.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Berke looked around his feet
  for the source of the thump, but Buford was already gone. He hopped
  away between legs and dove under a walkway before anyone even knew he
  was there.
  </p>
  <p>
  ❉	</p>
  <p>
  	Mr. Cess spoke gently, like a
  kindhearted uncle.</p>
  <p>
  	“I was hasty in my judgment
  of you, my boy,” he said. “As Chief Patent Administrator, it is
  my responsibility to ensure that such an extraordinary creation is
  properly cared for. I see now that you are up to that task.”</p>
  <p>
  	Bea lay quietly on the metal
  workbench.</p>
  <p>
  	Theo was still disoriented
  from the unprecedented reverse gondola ride. At any rate, he thought,
  Mr. Cess had reunited him with Bea, and that was a good thing.
  Perhaps all the trouble so far had just been a misunderstanding. Theo
  hoped so.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“That Digniggleby girl,
  though,” continued Cess. “Clearly unfit. To treat such a delicate
  creation like an old rag doll! You saw its condition when you
  arrived. It was a grave failure of judgment on your part to entrust
  it to such an frivolous child.”</p>
  <p>
  	Theo frowned. What had Valerie
  done? He had counted on her. Clearly, she had let him down and nearly
  cost Bea her life.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“It was a good thing I
  stepped in when I did, or our precious creature would most surely
  have been...,” began Cess. “No, perish the thought. You've
  learned your lesson, and I forgive you for the lapse.”</p>
  <p>
  	Theo was not sure what he had
  done to require Mr. Cess's forgiveness, but he did not see how it
  could serve him to argue. He said nothing.</p>
  <p>
  	 Mr. Cess's voice dripped with
  compassion.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“You know she needs you,”
  he said.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo looked at Bea and nodded.
  This much was certainly true.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I know,” he said. 	</p>
  <p>
  	It was a relief to hear Mr.
  Cess say it. But there was still something else on Theo's mind. He
  had to ask. He took a deep breath.</p>
  <p>
  	“Do you know where my dad
  is?” said Theo.</p>
  <p>
  	Mr. Cess sighed deeply.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I think you'd better come
  with me,” he said.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Mr. Cess led Theo up the
  spiral staircase to his office and gestured for him to sit down.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Family is so important,”
  said Mr. Cess, seemingly overcome with sadness. “And betrayal...
  Betrayal by a parent is a pain no child should ever have to suffer.”</p>
  <p>
  	Theo squinched his face in
  bewilderment. He had no idea what Mr. Cess could be talking about.
  Mr. Cess's voice trembled and his eyes welled with tears.</p>
  <p>
  	“Which is why it saddens me
  beyond words,” said Cess, “to be the bearer of what I'm sure will
  be devastating news.”</p>
  <p>
  	Mr. Cess strode over to the
  reel-to-reel tape player on his desk.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Your father came to me
  several days ago,” said Mr. Cess. “He was concerned about the
  security of his intellectual property.”</p>
  <p>
  	Mr. Cess's held his finger
  over the play lever of the tape player. 	</p>
  <p>
  	“To be honest,” said Mr.
  Cess. “I don't think he was himself. He was raving. You mustn't
  hold his words against him.”</p>
  <p>
  	“What? What did he say?”
  Theo made no effort to hide his confusion.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Mr. Cess pressed the lever. A
  hissing sound emanated from the speaker, broken by occasional clicks
  and silences. Then came Rudy's voice, tinny but unmistakeable: “<em>I'm
  going to leave my son. He's trying to steal my work!</em>”

  </p>
  <p>
  	Mr. Cess flicked the lever
  again quickly to stop the playback. “I'm so, so sorry, my boy.”</p>
  <p>
  	Theo was gobsmacked. It made
  no sense. Him? Steal his own father's work? How could his father have
  even conceived of such a... Theo paused. His mind raced. Of course,
  he had done that very thing. He knew he had been forbidden to dabble
  with his father's chemicals and bug-control methods. Yet he had gone
  ahead and done it anyway in secret. But... hadn't his father only
  been concerned for Theo's safety? He couldn't really have considered
  his own son a <em>threat</em>?

  </p>
  <p>
  	“This doesn't make any
  sense,” Theo barely managed to whisper.</p>
  <p>
  	“Indeed, what could be more
  senseless than a man's abandonment of his own flesh and blood,”
  said Mr. Cess. “The very fruit of his loins.”</p>
  <p>
  	Theo was speechless. Mr. Cess
  stood back and rocked lightly on his heels, letting it all sink in.	</p>
  <p>
  	“Alas and alack,” said Mr.
  Cess at last, his tone turning suddenly matter-of-fact. “Senseless
  things happen. We have to buck up.”</p>
  <p>
  	Theo was too confused to
  answer.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“It is time to think about
  the future, my boy,” said Mr. Cess. “Think about, what did you
  say its name was...”</p>
  <p>
  	“Bea,” said Theo.</p>
  <p>
  	“Yes, Bea. Think about
  that,” said Mr. Cess. “I will see to it that you have all the
  resources you need to help it. But not only that. No-one deserves to
  be alone, and that marvelous creature is no exception. I want to help
  you use your gifts to create more like it. Imagine, a whole family of
  wonderful, gentle creatures just like it as companions! All of them
  needing you, loving you.
  So grateful to <em>you</em>
  for bringing them into existence. What a happy, happy scene! You'll
  forget all about that deadbeat old man of yours.”
  </p>
  <p >
  	Theo sat quietly, considering
  Mr. Cess's words.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“I do think Bea would like
  some friends,” he said.</p>
  <p>
  	“Son,
  you just tell me what you need,” said Mr. Cess.  	</p>
  <p>
  ❉	</p>
  <p>
  	Shoppers bustled from shop to
  shop in the center of Mossville. A red-cheeked, curly-haired little
  girl waited in front of a cheese shop as her mother stood in the
  queue with her arms full of Brie. The little girl cradled a
  pajama-clad baby doll nearly as big as herself. She looked up to see
  Ballhatchet and Dooley standing in front of her. Her big, brown eyes
  widened.</p>
  <p>
  	“Official patent office
  business,” said Dooley, holding open the mouth of a large canvas
  bag. “I'm afraid we're going to have to take this.”</p>
  <p>
  	Ballhatchet snatched the baby
  doll out of the girl's hands. In a single swift motion, he popped the
  doll's head off and tossed it into the canvas bag. He handed the
  headless doll back to the girl, who  shrieked and burst into
  hysterical tears, then ran into the cheese shop.</p>
  <p>
  	“Kids today are awful
  materialistic,” said Ballhatchet as the two of them walked off down
  the street. “Somebody needs to tell them happiness isn't about
  having toys.”</p>
  <p>
  	“What do you reckon
  happiness is about, Ballhatchet?” asked Dooley. “For the sake of
  conversation.”</p>
  <p>
  	Ballhatchet pondered.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I guess it's about having a
  sense of self-worth and personal fulfillment in what you do,” said
  Ballhatchet. “That'd be my answer.”</p>
  <p>
  	They stopped at
  <em>M.Routin's
  Finer Baubles and Playthings for Today's Well-Mannered Child</em>
  and walked straight to the counter.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“We'll take the lot,” said
  Dooley, gesturing broadly at the doll section of the shop.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“The lot?” said the slim,
  bespectacled clerk.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“And we'll need a
  seventy-five percent discount, since we're only going to use the
  heads.”</p>
  <p >
  	“Why, that's not possible!”
  cried the clerk.</p>
  <p >
  	Ballhatchet leaned
  threateningly over the clerk and growled.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Official patent office
  business,” said Dooley. “Let's keep this orderly.”</p>
  <p >
  	A few minutes later,
  Ballhatchet and Dooley emerged from the shop laden with gigantic
  sacks full of doll heads over their shoulders.</p>
  <p>
  ❉	</p>
  <p >
  	The laboratory window was wide
  open and clouds of bugs moved freely in and out. They swarmed and
  eddied outside the window. Rows of mechanical bodies were laid out in
  various states of disassembly. Unused parts of Rudy's harvester were
  strewn about, other parts had been reconstituted as parts of the
  automatons. A heap of doll heads filled a one corner of the
  laboratory.
  </p>
  <p >
  	Theo went from one automaton
  to the next, screwing on heads, assembling parts, and administering
  chemicals. Bugs swirled in the window and responded to his
  concoctions.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Bea
  followed Theo closely, peeking out from behind his leg at her
  numerous imitators. She flinched  whenever one of them moved.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Mr. Cess also followed,
  watching intently over Theo's shoulder. He scratched notes in his
  note pad.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Ah, I see. Fascinating...
  Yes, yes. Extraordinary. The leonore and the rose powder... And that
  there is aphid honeydew I take it?”</p>
  <p>
  	“That holds them to the
  patterns,” said Theo. “It keeps the programs running smoothly.”</p>
  <p>
  	“Indeed!” said Mr. Cess,
  scribbling eagerly into his notebook. “It won't be long now, will
  it!”</p>
  <p>
  	They moved along to another
  part of the laboratory, where a group of automatons passed a bright
  red ball among themselves. Theo spritzed some fluid into the air and
  the group passed the ball faster and more precisely.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Theo turned to Bea, cowering
  behind his leg.</p>
  <p>
  	“Go on, Bea,” he said.
  “Join them. They're your friends.”</p>
  <p>
  	Bea shook her head.</p>
  <p>
  	“She's shy,” said Theo to
  Cess.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Mr. Cess smiled stiffly and
  wrote in his notebook.</p>
  <p>
  ❉

  </p>
  <p>
  	The
  patent office murmured with the rustle of paper and the muted buzz of
  administrative chatter, punctuated by the occasional bang of a rubber
  stamp. At the ding of the elevator the room went silent. The door
  opened and Cess stepped out. He was accompanied by Theo and Bea, who
  hugged Theo's leg tightly. The elevator shut behind them.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Ladies and gentlemen!”
  boomed Cess. “I have an announcement to make!”
  </p>
  <p>
  	The clerks held their breath.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“As you all know,” said
  Cess, “I have toiled ceaselessly for years at the service of the
  betterment of mankind. And for all of those years, you all have
  worked under me, attempting, in your own meager ways, to help me in
  my efforts.”</p>
  <p>
  	Theo looked out across the
  vast office space. The clerks sat bolt upright in their desks, so
  still they looked almost unreal.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“And yet,” continued Cess,
  “for all those years, nothing approaching the extraordinary
  creation that I am about to show you has ever appeared. Not until
  this lad here came along.”</p>
  <p>
  	Theo attempted a smile. He was
  happy about the praise, but the reception wasn't very warm. In fact,
  nobody moved a muscle.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“The truth is, this young,
  fresh-faced boy has more genius under his <em>fingernails</em>
  than the lot of you combined.”</p>
  <p >
  	Theo's smile faded. This
  wasn't quite the wording he'd have chosen. He was glad to see that
  the clerks still showed no response.</p>
  <p >
  	“Which is of course why he
  is now my second in command, and you are all still a bunch of
  dead-end ground-floor clerks. But at least that much is about to
  change. No longer will you toil without reward or recognition in this
  dismal little office!”</p>
  <p >
  	The elevator dinged again and
  the door opened. A dozen baby doll-headed automatons stepped out amid
  the noisy buzz of insects. The automatons each wore a burlap potato
  sack for clothing.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Ladies and gentlemen, meet
  your replacements,” said Cess.
  </p>
  <p >
  	At this, the clerks finally
  reacted. The room erupted in gasps as the automatons marched to their
  desks. The elevator rose again to collect another batch.
  </p>
  <p>
  	A
  young clerk piped up. “But Mr. Cess, what are <em>we</em>
  going to do?”</p>
  <p >
  	“Why, enjoy the autumn of
  your life, of course,” said Cess.</p>
  <p >
  	“But, I'm only twenty!”
  said the clerk.
  </p>
  <p >
  	“Well then, I would hunker
  down for a long winter if I were you,” said Cess. “Now off you
  go! Don't crowd the exits!”</p>
  <p>
  ❉

  </p>
  <p >
  	Ballhatchet and Dooley
  wandered through the crowded city center, collecting heads from any
  child they saw with a doll. Ballhatchet carried the bag. Dooley
  grabbed a bundle from a little boy, but it turned out to be a dog and
  yelped, giving Dooley a fright.</p>
  <p >
  	A notice plastered on a light
  post caught Ballhatchet's eye. It read:</p>
  <p>
  	<em>PUBLIC
  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE MAYOR</em></p>
  <p>
  <em>Tuesday Afternoon</em></p>
  <p>
  <em>Main Town Square</em></p>
  <p >
  	“What's this all about?”
  said Ballhatchet.</p>
  <p >
  	“You got me,” said Dooley.</p>
  <p >
  	Ballhatchet and Dooley looked
  at each other. It was the kind of thing Mr. Cess would want to be
  apprised of before it happened, rather than after.</p>
  <p >
  	“We'd better head back,”
  said Dooley.
