  	Mayor
  Digniggleby sat in his study gazing miserably at the shriveling
  balloon poodle.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Daddy, we need to get Bea
  back,” came Valerie's voice from behind him. She hadn't knocked.
  Digniggleby turned around in his swivel chair.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The pain on her face broke his
  heart.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I can't,” said
  Digniggleby.</p>
  <p>
  	“Of course you can! We have
  to!” insisted Valerie.</p>
  <p>
  	“No,” said Digniggleby.
  “I'm a fool. I'm no match for him.”</p>
  <p>
  	Valerie's lip trembled.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“You can stand up to him!”
  she said. “You can do it for me!”</p>
  <p>
  	“I-I wish I could,
  sweetheart,” said Digniggleby. “But the truth is, without him I'm
  nothing. All of this, everything we have, he could take it away in a
  moment. I have nothing to offer without him.”</p>
  <p>
  	Digniggleby looked away from
  his daughter. He couldn't bear to see the tears welling up in her
  eyes.</p>
  <p>
  	“I can't go against him,”
  he said. “I'm sorry.”</p>
  <p>
  	Valerie stood in the doorway
  for a few seconds, then turned abruptly and left without a word. He
  could hear her muffled sobs as she ran down the hall.

  <p>
  	Theo
  ate his breakfast with somewhat less gusto than he had eaten dinner
  the night before. The smell of the sausages was tempting, but he felt
  he should resist out of solidarity with Buford. Besides, he reminded
  himself, it was <em>toad</em>.</p>
  <p>
  	The inn was quiet and sunlight
  filtered through the trees and into the window. The old man from the
  night before snoozed in the corner. The clip of his headgear held the
  dead butt of a cigar. Dorothy looked at Theo sadly.</p>
  <p>
  	“It
  breaks my heart,” she said. “Think of all life has to offer.
  Think of all <em>you</em>
  have to offer.”</p>
  <p>
  	“I'm not offering anything,”
  said Theo. “I don't see anybody offering to help me get out of
  here, either. All anybody cares about around here are convenient
  gizmos. Clockwork doorstops.” Theo gestured at a   contraption of
  chutes and pulleys located over the stove. “Do you need that to fry
  an egg?”
  </p>
  <p>
  	“It takes a lot of the
  guesswork out of it,” said Dorothy.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Well I don't care about
  that stuff,” said Theo. “Practical shmactical.”</p>
  <p>
  	The old man opened one eye.</p>
  <p>
  	“I know where I've heard
  that kind of talk before,” he said. “The hermit used to talk like
  that. Back when he talked to people at all. If you're wondering where
  that kind of thinking leads, it's not pretty. Last I heard, the old
  kook wouldn't even use a fork and a knife.”</p>
  <p>
  	“You didn't need to bring
  him up, Harry,” said Dorothy.</p>
  <p>
  	“Who's that?” said Theo.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“What can it hurt?” said
  Harry. “Sounds like a kindred spirit. No sense delaying your
  destiny, boy. May as well get yourself fitted for a loincloth and
  skedaddle.”</p>
  <p>
  	“What's he talking about?”
  said Theo to Dorothy.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“The hermit is just a crazy
  old fool who doesn't understand Kook Bog,” said Dorothy. “He's
  the last person you ought to emulate, believe me.”</p>
  <p>
  	“Ha!”
  exclaimed the Harry. “Doesn't understand indeed. Nobody understands
  Kook Bog better! He knows everything there is to know about this
  place and he understands just fine. He <em>rejects</em>
  it is all. That's what stings. They say the only reason he’s still here is
  that he rejects Mossville even more.”</p>
  <p>
  	“You mean he knows how to get out?” said Theo.</p>
  <p>
  	“So they say,” said Harry.
  “It doesn't matter though. He won't help you. He doesn't help
  anybody.”</p>
  <p>
  	“Tell me how to find him,”
  said Theo.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Why would I do that?”
  said Harry.</p>
  <p>
  	“Why indeed!” said
  Dorothy. “The last thing a boy your age needs is to be traipsing
  around the wilderness around here.”</p>
  <p>
  	“He can traipse all he
  wants, for all I care,” said Harry. “He doesn't need my help for
  that.”</p>
  <p>
  	“What if I found a way to
  get out of Kook Bog?” said Theo. “Don't you want that?”</p>
  <p>
  	“Hmm,” said Harry. He
  fished a fresh cigar out of his pocket and replaced the butt on the
  clip of his headgear. He turned a key to wind a spring mechanism, and
  the various parts of the contraption clicked into motion. A lighter
  flicked and extended to light the cigarette and the bellows opened to
  suck air through the cigar. With a little hiss a cloud of smoke burst
  into his face. “Not especially.”</p>
  <p>
  	“Well, I bet a lot of people
  around here do,” said Theo. “You could do it for them, if you're
  so eager to help people.”</p>
  <p>
  	“I'll
  tell you what,” said Harry. “I'll make you a deal. I'll tell you
  how to find the hermit. Ballpark, that is. Nobody knows exactly where
  he is from time time to time, but I can tell you how to get to where
  he's been seen. If you manage to get yourself out of Kook Bog, then
  that'll be the end of it. But if you <em>don't</em>,
  then you pay me.”</p>
  <p>
  	“Harry...,” said Dorothy
  in warning tone. But she only shook her head.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I don't have anything to
  pay you with,” said Theo.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“Oh, yes you do,” said
  Harry. He looked at the lump in Theo's shirt pocket.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Buford squirmed uneasily.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“I love the sausages,”
  said Harry. “But it sure has been a long time since I had a nice
  fillet all to myself.”
  </p>
  <p>
  	It
  scarcely crossed his mind that he might be sacrificing Buford by
  agreeing. <em>Of
  course</em>
  he would get out of Kook Bog, he thought. He was impatient,
  irritated, and impulsive. He agreed to Harry's conditions
  immediately.
  </p>
  <p>
  	An hour later he stood at the
  neglected edge of the village where decks and walkways ended. Some of
  the walkways were partially sunken into the mud. Some had missing
  boards and planks so rotten they gave way like wet bread. Theo took a
  piece of old lumber from a broken handrail and extended it into the
  mud. He felt around for a shallow patch. He stepped off the walkway
  and waist deep into the bog.</p>
  <p>
  	The going was exhausting. It
  was slow enough having to wade through the mud which sometimes came
  as high as his neck. Worse still was the winding, haphazard route he
  needed to follow to stay in shallow mud and keep his head above the
  surface.  He got as far away from the village as he could before he
  stopped to rest. He pulled himself up on to a broad, flat rock. He
  looked back at the village. He'd made it further than he thought.
  </p>
  <p>
  	In the distance ahead loomed
  the great black ridge that separated Kook Bog from Mossville. He
  could hear the muffled roar of the mud river at its base.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Sitting on the rock he
  contemplated the deal he'd made. There was no doubt he needed to look
  for his father and to rescue Bea. To do those things he was
  determined to escape from Kook Bog. When the old man made his offer
  he'd jumped at the chance. But now, with some time to think in the
  middle of this oozing, burbling wilderness, he feared he had mistaken
  his own determination for certainty. There was no guarantee he would
  find the hermit, and even if he did there was no guarantee he'd be
  able to convince the hermit to help him.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Buford squirmed in Theo's
  pocket.</p>
  <p>
  	“I'm not going to let
  anything happen to you,” said Theo. “We're going to get out of
  here.”</p>
  <p>
  	He only wished he could
  convince himself.</p>
  <p>
  	Gnats and flies swarmed around
  the rag on his arm, attracted to the dried-up stains of leonore
  extract. Theo waved them away.
  </p>
  <p>
  	He withdrew a tightly folded
  piece of paper from inside his belt. He unfolded it and studied the
  crudely inked map. He looked around himself to try to identify
  landmarks drawn on the map. He frowned. The old man had given him
  chicken scratches. Was the scribble in the corner supposed to be the
  copse of trees to his right or the cluster of reeds to the left?
  </p>
  <p>
  	Overhead, dark clouds
  threatened.
  </p>
  <p>
  	After altogether too much
  guesswork with the map, Theo eventually made it to a broad expanse of
  rushing mud dotted by rocks. He could make out the words “rock
  field” on the part of the map corresponding to where he thought he
  was. So far so good.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The clouds had made good on
  their threats, and a steady rain had been gaining in strength for
  nearly an hour. The rocks were slippery and mud rushed in knotty
  rivulets between them.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The rocks varied in size and
  in the distance between them. Some were no more than an easy step
  away. Others required an effort to leap and some luck to avoid
  slipping into the rushing mud below and breaking his neck.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The rocks became sparser ahead
  as the mud deepened to become a wide, fast river. Far away in the
  hazy distance up the river, Theo could make out the enormous black
  base of the Kook Bog end of the Suction-Flux Hydro-Debogilator.
  </p>
  <p>
  	To Theo's right and left the
  rocks were still near enough to each other to continue. He would have
  to follow the banks either upstream or downstream.</p>
  <p>
  	Theo consulted the map, but it
  was so wet and smeared as to be completely unreadable. Theo could
  make out the rough shape of an arrow drawn along the bank of the
  river, but the ink had soaked clear through the paper. He couldn't
  tell which side of the map was the front. He turned the paper over
  and over, trying to ascertain which direction the arrow pointed. What
  once had been words were now just cloudy patches of ink. The soaked
  paper disintegrated to pulp in his fingers.
  </p>
  <p>
  	There was nothing left to do
  but take his chances. Theo took a long step over to the nearest rock
  to his right, upstream.
  </p>
  <p>
  	At that moment, Buford leaped
  from Theo's pocket and landed smack in the middle of the rock Theo
  had just left.
  </p>
  <p>
  	“What are you doing?”
  cried Theo.</p>
  <p>
  	Buford leaped again in the
  opposite direction. He landed on the next rock in the downstream
  direction. He turned around and looked up at Theo.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Buford seemed determined to
  follow the banks downstream. Theo shrugged. The map had crumbled to
  nothing in the heavy rain and he had no idea where to go now. The
  toad's instincts couldn't be any worse than his own. He stepped back
  onto the downstream rock and followed Buford.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Buford leaped again, and again
  Theo stepped to follow him. But this time his foot did not land as it
  should. He had not seen the dark patch of wet moss on the rock.
  Before he knew what had happened he had tumbled head over heels
  straight into the rushing flood of mud.
